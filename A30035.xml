            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAVING herein collected my Experience, both of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſcipline of the Schiſm of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> ſhewing the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency thereof, from Matter of Fact, I thought it but my Reaſonable Service to offer the ſame to your Judicious Peruſal, and Chriſtian Conſideration; that ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apprehenſion you ſhall have, touching the Premiſes, you may put your helping Hand, not only to a farther Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Arguments, (which yet is needful enough) but alſo for the regaining of ſuch as (who thro' the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:65629:3"/> Slights and Plauſible Pretenſions of theſe Seducers) are miſled, and carry'd away; and thereby not only vindicate the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> but defend the Church of <hi>England</hi> from the most horrible Scandals, cast upon both, by the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not acquaint you with the great Labour, and unwearied Pains, our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Divines have taken to Regain ſuch, who have been ſeduced to Adhere to the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and the vast number of Volumes, writ on that Account, and not without Good and Great Succeſs, as we ſee this Day, Thanks be to God: But behold! Here is a <hi>NEW ROME</hi> ariſing, which Builds on the ſame Bottom, <hi>i. e. INFALLIBILITY, &amp;c,</hi> and whoſe Principles were first Hammer'd at that Forge, and Coyn'd at that Mint, and are carrying on by the ſame Craft and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected Policy; and as Dangerous to the Reformed Religion, which our Martyr'd Anceſtors ſuffered in the Flames for, as <hi>Rome</hi> Her Elder Siſter. (And this you ſhould ſee, had they but Power; an Inſtance of which is their Proceedings in <hi>Penſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.)</hi> But notwithſtanding all this, how few are concern'd hereat? How few lay it
<pb facs="tcp:65629:3"/> to Heart? This is Cauſe of Lamentation and Aſtoniſhment; and yet, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how long I my ſelf was deceived by them, I do the leſs marvel; eſpecially, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what Equivocations and Reſerve they make in their Arguments, whether Verbal, or in Writing; how Induſtrious they are to hide themſelves, and their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, expreſſing themſelves in Dubious Terms, that want Explication; pretending to Seriouſneſs, Sincerity, Plainneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when none ſo Inſincere, ſo Deceitful, and Falſe in the World, as in a Thouſand Things I could mention; whereby it is manifest, that they are the falſe Prophets which Christ foretold of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Aad therefore, if what I can contribute towards the Diſcovery of this Painted, as well as Diſguiſed Harlot, may be uſeful to the Church of God, and the Miniſters thereof, in bringing forth my known Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I ſhall be glad, and rejoyce therein.</p>
            <p>I cannot but know, that herein you will meet with many Deficiences, for want of Parts and Learning, requiſite to ſuch a Work: But ſince your Generoſity is ſo mixed with Chriſtian Charity, as to accept
<pb facs="tcp:65629:4"/> the Will for the Deed, as in my former Eſſays, I have at this time preſumed to preſent this Rough Draught to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal, and as my Mite, to cast it into your Treaſury; hoping, that until the <hi>Quakers</hi> can juſtly charge me with a Falſe Quotation, (which, as they never yet could do, ſo I hope they never ſhall) this may paſs under your Patronage, as a Defence against the <hi>Quakers</hi> Invectives; and it may be, when I cannot ſpeak for my ſelf; eſpecially, when there is not a Man of you, but are Sharers with me in the ſame Reproaches for the Goſpel's ſake.

            <p>AS I told you in my Firſt Impreſſion, I tell you now, that the Wicked plotteth againſt the Righteous<note n="†" place="margin">Pſ. 37.12.</note>, as <hi>David</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth: This ſhews the <hi>Churches</hi> Calamity, and 'tis as certain, that the Lord laughs at theſe Plotters, <hi>v.</hi> 13. this is the Churches Remedy. Now whilſt God Laughs at the Plots of the Wicked, his People have no cauſe to Mourn; eſpecially when he would have us to Rejoyce with him, ſaying, <hi>The Righteous ſhall ſee, and fear, and laugh at him</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 52.6.</note>. But do you think that we of the Laity ought to ſee this <hi>Plot</hi> carrying on by a United Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt the <hi>Church,</hi> and ſay nothing, nor be at all concerned? I think not: For <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>They have conſulted together with one conſent, they are confederate againſt thee</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Pſ. 83.5.</note>. Do you think, that becauſe God hath promis'd in his Word, that Kings ſhall be as Nurſing-Fathers to his <hi>Church</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Iſa. 49.23.</note>, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has commanded his Servants that wait at the Altar, to Cry aloud, to give us Notice of theſe Seducers; that therefore we are wholly excuſed, and unconcerned? I tell you nay; therefore up, let us be doing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65629:5"/>
            <p>For Chriſt's Myſtical Body, which is his Church, conſiſts of many Members, but all the Members have not the ſame Office; yet the Eye cannot ſay to the Foot, I have no need of thee; ſo that there is ſome Uſe and Service for us all; (provided we keep our Places,) in the <hi>Church Militant;</hi> if we be living Members, and ſenſible of the <hi>Churches</hi> Calamity. And if ſo, as ſo it is, I beg leave to remind you of what I conceive to be every private Chriſtian's Duty; which is, to uſe all Chriſtian and Lawful Means to diſcover this Plot, and to manifeſt the Contrivers thereof. We ſee now, as well as in the Days of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how zealous the Leaders of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are, they compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelytes: They appear as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians did in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> with the very likeneſs of things good in themſelves, but all is but counterfeit, a bare likeneſs; appear fair, like painted Sepulchers and whited Walls, but the inſide of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is all Rottenneſs. How do they ſend up and down, to invite to their <hi>Meetings?</hi> How do they diſperſe their <hi>Books,</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, ſee <hi>p.</hi> 144. as well as beyond Sea? How do they preſent them to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> the <hi>Juſtices,</hi> even to all Ranks and Degrees of Men? And ſhall we ſit ſtill, and declare to the World, we have no Zeal for our Holy Religion, which our Martyred Anceſtors ſuffered in the Flames for?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65629:5"/>
            <p>Wherefore let us put on Courage, and excite one another's Zeal, leſt God in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remove the Candleſtick, and plant his <hi>Goſpel</hi> amongſt a People more deſerving: And therefore let us put <hi>Books</hi> into the Hands of our <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> to inform their Underſtandings in theſe Matters; that they may be capable to be Eye-Witneſſes of this diſmal Tragedy now upon the Stage: And into the Hands of our Chriſtian <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> who at preſent may be unthinking, and not ſee the Danger they are in; and alſo caution'd to beware of the Deceivers of our Times; who come in Sheeps-cloathing, but inwardly they are Ravening Wolves: And into the Hands of the Well-diſpoſed amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> for the regaining of them: And this will be a Means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and lay waſte the Deſign and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy now on Foot.</p>
            <p>And for your Comfort this I can tell you, that many are now coming off <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> embracing <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and let us meet them, and with all Sweetneſs invite them Home. There are about Six or Eight of their Writers and Teachers come off, and Hundreds that were caught by their Snare; ſome of them that have been <hi>Quakers</hi> theſe Forty Years, are now in Print againſt them: And ſince I have been in <hi>London,</hi> I have had many of them come to Viſit me, with Thanks in their Mouths, to Me and Others, who have dealt plainly with them;
<pb facs="tcp:65629:6"/> bidding me keep on my Pace, and not to ſpare Proud <hi>Babel:</hi> And from others I have had Letters of the ſame Import: And in Hopes it will be good News to many of you, I will recite a Paſſage or two out of <hi>W. Mather</hi>'s his Book, Printed within this Month; he lives in <hi>Bedfordſhire,</hi> and hath been a <hi>Quaker</hi> theſe Forty Years, and an Old Acquaintance of mine 38 Years ſince, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>An Anſwer to the</hi> Switch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>W. Mather,</hi> p. 1, 8. <hi>It is</hi> (ſays <hi>W. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>) <hi>impoſſible that the Pens now in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie againſt us</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhould be put a Stop to, before there is an Order given forth,</hi> (<hi>from the</hi> Second-Days Meeting) <hi>for the</hi> Reformation <hi>of our</hi> Preachers; <hi>and alſo a Book of</hi> Retractations <hi>of the</hi> Errors <hi>of our</hi> Friends <hi>printed</hi> Books. — <hi>A Man that does but tell you,</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>&amp;c. of your</hi> Miſtakes, <hi>that they might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, had need have the Armour of Grace in his Heart, as little</hi> David <hi>had, when he encountred great</hi> Goliah; <hi>yea, as bold as</hi> David<hi>'s Worthies were, who ventured their Lives to fetch Water from the</hi> Philiſtines <hi>Camp; to be ſure you will Scoff at him at a high rate, Wound or Kill him; as you account that</hi> Criſp, Bugg, Keith, <hi>&amp;c. are Dead to the Life of Truth, for oppoſing your</hi> Errors; <hi>Wounded them (it's true) you have, for which God will Judge you: For every one of them at firſt only deſired that
<pb facs="tcp:65629:6"/> you might bring your Deeds to the Light, to be Tried by the</hi> Scriptures: <hi>But inſtead of Anſwering their Chriſtian Deſires for your Good, you fall upon them, and wound them, and make them grieve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pag. 9. <hi>Conſider this, you fierce Deſpiſers of all thoſe who deſire your</hi> Reformation <hi>in</hi> Doctrine <hi>and</hi> Practice. <hi>You know where this Curſed Thing is, that cauſeth all this Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance; you ſtill hide it, but out it muſt come, and be beaten to Pouder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I beſeech you to conſider, Firſt, what Damage hath befaln our <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Falſe Doctrine</hi> couched under the fair Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> next, their Induſtry of ſpreading them, as in <hi>p.</hi> 1.44. but moreover, how they give away that Fallacious Book, <hi>Anguis Flagellatus,</hi> &amp;c. not only to Members of <hi>Parliament, Judges, Juſtices, Lawyers,</hi> and indeed Men of all Ranks; but as I have been told, ſend beyond Sea 500 together. And foraſmuch as there are many Excellent Books wrote by that Reverend Author of the Book intituled, <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. that, and his Defence of it; his Book, <hi>Satan Diſro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,</hi> &amp;c. and that about <hi>Water Baptiſm;</hi> and alſo by that Learned Author <hi>Geo. Keith,</hi> and divers others, which diſcover the Horrible Fraud and Pernicious Principles of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> I ſay, let us not let a <hi>Parliament-Man,</hi> a <hi>Judge, Juſtice,</hi> or any others, where we ſee a Service for the <hi>Church,</hi> be without a <hi>Book</hi> to inform their Judgments,
<pb facs="tcp:65629:7"/> and rectifie the Miſtakes of others. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many Books wrote by our Pious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines in Defence of our Holy Religion, againſt the Attempts of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and alſo the great Benefit thereof, and good Effects they have had, both to Preſerve our Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Communion with us, and to Regain many that were wavering, and ſome that were ſtrayed away. And as a further exciting our Zeal, let us be often Meditating on the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Divine Writ, and Pray God to Illuminate our Underſtandings, and thereby make us able to Read them to our Comfort.</p>
            <p>I cannot but remember with what reſtleſs Zeal my ſelf and others uſed to Advance <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> in the beginning, and how we ſent our <hi>Books</hi> the Nation over, by Pack-Horſes, and otherwiſe: I my ſelf have given away Twenty Shillings worth at a <hi>Meeting;</hi> and ſhall we be now leſs Zealous in Diſperſing <hi>Books</hi> to detect their Errors, than they have been to broach them, and are now to defend them? God forbid. Oh let it not be ſaid ſo of ſuch as love God, and are Orthodox in the Faith; that love the Scriptures, and have a true value for the Sacred Ordinances inſtituted by our Bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt! Thus have I imparted my Mind, and I hope without Offence, who am,</p>

               <p>And in order to which, I ſhall make ſome brief Remarks, which may ſerve not only as a Forerunner to a more compleat Anſwer, which I underſtand is preparing; but may (together with what follows in the enſuing Diſcourſe) paſs for a tolerable Anſwer, at leaſt raze the Foundation of their <hi>Anguis Flagellatus, &amp;c.</hi> and that in theſe following Particulars.</p>

               <p>Reader, you have as above ſeen the Title, <hi>The Snake in the Graſs, or, Satan transformed into an Angel of Light,</hi> &amp;c. This Title was well given to that Book, which made ſuch a plain Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Juggles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. lye in wait to deceive by their cunning Slights, and deep Craft; as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> above all People, ſhew by their double Meanings: For in one Book they'll pretend to own the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be of Divine Authority, and the beſt Book in the World; yet in their other ſort of Books, they ſay, it is <hi>Death, Duſt, Serpents Meat, Beaſtly Ware, a Rotten Foundation,</hi> &amp;c. In one ſort of their Books they pretend to own a Scripture-Trinity, whilſt in their other ſort of Books, they condemn the Three Perſons to the Lake and the Pit; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cast out, <hi>p.</hi> 10. by <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> &amp;c.</note> as I elſewhere from their Books have proved: And this Two-fac'd Practice gave occaſion for that Title. Yet now have they given their Book under Conſideration the Title of <hi>Anguis Flagellatus, or, A Switch for the Snake;</hi> and by this Slight, and piece of Cunning, think to avoid the Dint of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and turn it upon himſelf; tho' indeed they have thereby Laſht themſelves. Beſides, they have perverted his Meaning; for they knew well enough, that Obſcure <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> was the Snake which that Reverend Author deſigned to diſcover: And they ought in Point of Juſtice, either to have acquitted themſelves thereof by way of Argument, or elſe to have condemned one ſort of their Books, which rendred them guilty of his Charge.

               </head>
               <p>Now as to Splitting <hi>Sentences,</hi> mangling, curtailing, and dropping what is not for their Turn, let us ſee whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not guilty of what they ſo fearfully complain of, as a Fault in the Author of <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> &amp;c. almoſt quite through their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis,</hi> &amp;c. For this, ſee their <hi>Standard of the Lord lifted up,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>Chr. Atkinſon</hi> and <hi>Edw. Burroughs,</hi> where <hi>E. B.</hi> in his Epiſtle ſaid thus; <hi>I was moved to go ſee him,</hi> [John Gilpen] <hi>and his Will was at Liberty, above the Judgment; tho' the Judgment was upon the Head of the Beaſt in him, and a true Power working,</hi> which I did own; <hi>but his will not being kept in Subjection,</hi> &amp;c. Now the words, <hi>which I did own,</hi> the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> drop, as not for their Turn: For it would have ſhewed, that this <hi>E.

Edit. 3. p. 288. and <hi>Anguis Flagellat.</hi> p. 446.</note>. And a ſecond Inſtance of their Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing is, the Author of the <hi>Snake in the Graſs</hi> hath charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> with an Idolatrous Letter of <hi>Joſiah Coale</hi>'s to <hi>G.

                  <note n="†" place="margin">See the <hi>Snake,</hi> &amp;c. Edit. 3. p. 115. and <hi>Anguis, &amp;c.</hi> p. 180.</note>. I ſay, theſe words were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly blaſphemouſly Idolatrous, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers were forced to drop them, altho' the other part ſhews ſufficiently the Quakers Idolatry. But, thirdly, and that I may ſhew my Reader that this is no new thing, to find them curtailing, mincing and mangling Sentences, how much ſoever they complain of others, I ſhall recite one Paſſage more to ſhew it, their old Craft, and cunning Slight, by which they lye in wait to Deceive; and that from an old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Practitioner in that Black Art, namely, <hi>Geo. Whitehead,</hi> who in one of his Books, <hi>The Contentious Apoſtate Recharged,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6, 7. citing one Line here, one Line there, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times five Words out of the middle of a Line: As for Example, out of my Book, <hi>Battering Rams againſt New</hi>-Rome, thus, <hi>p.</hi> 12. <hi>l.</hi> 10. <hi>in ſome</hi> 50 l. <hi>per Annum,</hi> not touching the Matter either before or after: A notable nonſuch way to confute an Adverſary, and to diſpatch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. Again, <hi>Your only way is, when Caſh grows low, to iſſue out;</hi> and then he gives a good Leap out of this Line, (having taken the middle of it) into the middle of the next Line, and then takes out of it a Letter and two Words, <hi>viz. A General Epiſtle;</hi> and from thence he skips to the laſt three Words in the next Line, <hi>i. e. Your own Service;</hi> and now he hops to the next
<pb facs="tcp:65629:12"/> Line, and takes one ſingle Word, <hi>i. e. for,</hi> and leaves the next Word <hi>as,</hi> and then catches up the next Word <hi>Money;</hi> and then gives a good ſtride into another Line, and gets a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Words, <hi>i. e. 'Tis a good Encouragement to your Preachers and Paraſites;</hi> which being put together, as we uſe to join Syllables when I was a Boy and went to School, it runs thus; <hi>Your way is, when your Caſh grows low, to iſſue out a General Epiſtle for your own Service, for Money; 'tis a great Encouragement to your Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Paraſites.</hi> Now, Reader, doſt thou not think <hi>Whitehead</hi> was ſorely put to it to Anſwer that Book of mine? But grant that; yet who would think that theſe Men ſhould find fault with others for ſplitting Sentences, for mincing and mangling into Bits and Scraps? I ſay, who would imagine that theſe foul Perverters, theſe horrible Jugglers, ſhould have the Impudence to complain of others? And which is ſtill worſe, without Cauſe? For of this I am ſure, there is not a Man that Quotes fairer, nor with more Caution than that Author has all along done. For tho' neither he, nor Mr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> nor my ſelf, do often quote from one another; and all to avoid their cauſeleſs Cavils; yet I am confident no Men can be more careful than we all are. I will not deny, but we all three lend that Author Books, as we do one to another; and as I within a Month lent a Friend of his, and for his Uſe, Forty of the Quakers old Books, Printed in 1653, 1654, 1655, and 1656, moſt of which he never ſaw before; yet if we did Quote from one another, I hope it would be of as good Authority, as for them to Quote one another's Books, which yet they frequently do<note n="*" place="margin">An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance you have in their <hi>Ang.

<pb facs="tcp:65629:12"/> by ſplitting Sentences, and dropping what is not for their Turn; as in the firſt and ſecond Inſtances, and an hundred more could I enlarge thereon. But this is but a Preface, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt be brief; yet I ſhall raze their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which is Hypocriſie. But to proceed.</p>

               <p>Having by this time ſhewed Ten Inſtances, that the Quakers do not hold a Negative Doctrine to the Romiſh Church, in the moſt Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Errours in that Church; and yet agree with her in as many Inſtances, that ſhe is the Only Church, out of which there is no Salvation, as they ſay, I ſhould have proceeded to as many Inſtances of their Pretence to Spiritual Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning; but I ſhall mention but two, <hi>viz.

               </p>
               <p>Another Place like unto it, is in <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 58. thus; <hi>None need to give us Diſcerning or Judgment, Chriſt hath furniſhed us already, and doth on all Occaſions.</hi>

               <pb facs="tcp:65629:17"/>
               <p>But that I may do the Quakers Juſtice, let me give one Inſtance where I may ſhew, that the Quakers differ in Doctrine from the Romiſh Church, and if I miſtake not, from all other Chriſtian Churches: And indeed, that is one main Reaſon why I thus Unmask New-<hi>Rome:</hi> For as <hi>A. S.</hi> the Roman Catholick ſaid, ſo ſay I; as in his <hi>Reconciler of Religions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>The true Church (Militant) is compoſed of Good and Bad, of Wheat and Tares,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>pag.</hi> 254, to <hi>pag.</hi> 284. whether their Church be all Wheat.</note>. Another of their Teachers, in his Book, <hi>A Rod to drive out the Wild Boars,</hi> &amp;c. ſays, <hi>There is no Hypocrite in the true Church; they that ſay there are Hypocrites in the true Church, do erre from the Spirit of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. Read the Fourteenth Chapter herein, and ſee whether the Quakers have not Erred; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Grain looks like Wheat, nay, not ſo good as Tares, but meer Darnel.</p>
               <p>And as to their Fling at me about my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, as in their <hi>Anguis Flagellatus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 432. I ſhall ſay little of it in this place, but referr to <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. herein, <hi>pag.</hi> 295, to <hi>pag.</hi> 307. only thus much I may add, That there was but about a Third Part of my Creditors that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded at 10 <hi>s.</hi> in the Pound, the reſt I have and muſt Pay the Whole: Nay ſome of thoſe that did Compound I have ſince Paid the Whole. And this Offer I now make, That if the Quakers will Engage that thoſe of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſhall Pay me, what they Broke in my Debt, or that Died in my Debt, and have not
<pb n="xxxiii" facs="tcp:65629:17"/> paid me, I then will promiſe to pay every Man to a Groat; and if ſo, the Quakers have no great cauſe to boaſt. And yet I can in good Conſcience ſay, that great part of my difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been by and through the great injuſtice and implacable malice of my Adverſaries the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; who have yet no reaſon, ſince my labour have been for their good, though againſt their Wills; and for which they have, by all their endeavours, ſought my Ruin: And their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions herein have been very ſtrong, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted with great vigour. For as on the one hand they have uſed all poſſible means to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me unworthy of the Clergies notice; a hint whereof you have in <hi>p.</hi> 299. ſo on the other hand, ſome of them have ſuggeſted (by private inſinuations) to my Creditors, that they need not to comply, for that the Clergy would aſſiſt me; nay, one Quaker nearly Related to me by Marriage, and for whom I have done divers good offices; it may be, more than any Man living, no nearer related than I was; yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to a Kinſman of his, in order to blaſt my Reputation, (when I had moſt need of his good word and aſſiſtance) that I deſigned to Sell my Eſtate, and leave my Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; which thing I call Heaven and Earth to witneſs, I never deſigned, nor did it ever enter into my heart. And much more to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe could I relate, which I ſhall not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to paſs by all their Unkindneſs and Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the Day of my Adverſity; being truly thankful to God in the firſt place, and to his Servants in the next, who have enabled me to continue to this Day, not only to live free from want, but to maintain my Family with all things neceſſary, even beyond what I could have
<pb n="xxxiv" facs="tcp:65629:18"/> expected; for in all Humane probability, had not God raiſed me up Friends, I had been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable enough, by reaſon my Adverſaries rage was ſo extenſive; who thirſted after nothing more than my utter Ruin, as I could ſhew, were it needful, in many caſes.</p>
               <p>And thanks be to God, through my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe Cauſe I have been ingaged (though a weak and unworthy Inſtrument) and for whoſe Sake nothing has been to dear too part withal, he has raiſed me Friends, and made me able to ſay, as one of old did, That I have been able to run through a Troop, and to leap over a Wall, which I once thought would have been too high for me; ſo that I will not fear what Man can do unto me; for God will ſcatter mine Enemies, and confound mine Adverſaries, and raiſe me Friends in deſpite of the Rage of Satan and all his Inſtruments. But ſince in their late Prints and Appeals, the Quakers do ſo magnifie their own honeſty, I ſhall, as I have in the Cage of Unclean Birds, <hi>p.</hi> 249. to <hi>p.</hi> 286. once more add to the number a third ſort, not at preſent thinking it needful to add the fruits of others that lye ſnuge in the Cage, and which as yet have not ſeen it needful to ſhew their Feathers, ſince the hint already given have had ſome ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and I hope may have more, towards their Humiliation and Amendment: But that they may ſee (if yet they do not ſee) that they are left like other Men, and overtaken with the ſame Infirmities, I ſhall ſet forth not only Ten of their Teachers, of great Note, but likewiſe Ten of their Hearers, (for I love to proceed by number and weight) not that I ſhall this time put <hi>John Kilborn,</hi> and ſome others,
<pb n="xxxv" facs="tcp:65629:18"/> into the Cage to their fellow Birds; but, as I ſaid, in regard they ſo often brag of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty in <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> I ſhall therefore brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerve to them, and for their Humiliation, if by any means they may be wrought upon to be Humbled, a few of their miſcarriages on that Account, that their vain pretence to a Sinleſs Perfection may be retracted, and at laſt come to make Confeſſion of their Sins, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thereof, and Amend their ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt I ſhall name of this ſort is <hi>Gerald Roberts,</hi> who was the greateſt Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>G.

            <p>I Have ſeen thy Book, <hi>A Rambling Pilgrim,</hi> &amp;c. ſaid to be an Anſwer to two Books of mine, <hi>i. e. The Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Modeſt Defence,</hi> &amp;c. which is ſo far from being an Anſwer, that it doth not touch at the Tenth part of the Books; and that little you ſpoke to, have (to them who will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Books) rather confirms what I charge you withal, than otherwiſe. But that I may ſhew (for your Peoples ſake,) how you wilfully miſtake me, and the ſtate of the Charge, and then miſlead your People, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I find the firſt part of your Book is chiefly to inſinuate that I ſaid the Sermon was <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi>'s, of his Forming, of his Preaching, and that in ſo many Words; and thereupon you call it Forgery. Now,
<pb n="xxxviii" facs="tcp:65629:20"/> 
               <hi>George,</hi> this is all Fallacy: For thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <hi>George,</hi> in thy Conſcience, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to have it believed, that you at your Yearly Meeting Preached that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sermon, in ſo many Words; but that I did it to expoſe your Errors contain'd in your Books, out of which that Sermon was by me form'd; and in <hi>p.</hi> 108. and <hi>p.</hi> 222. of the Second Edition, it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>A Sermon for</hi> George Whitehead <hi>to hold Forth,</hi> &amp;c. And the Chapter before gives ſeveral Reaſons why I proceeded in that unuſual method: So that your way to have done your Cauſe good, and your People good, had been to have confuted me; firſt, Touching your Doctrine, which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of your Books. Secondly, That your Practice is otherwiſe than by me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. This had been your way to have confuted my Arguments, and to have eſtabliſhed your People. But for you thus to act againſt Light and Knowledge, is ſuch a ſelf-condemn'd Practice, that as for your own ſake, as well as your People whom you miſlead, I could be glad to ſee you leave it now in your Old Age. Take one inſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Rambling Pilgrim,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 5. <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> makes <hi>Geor. Whitehead</hi> thus ſpeak, <hi>Friends, I am now come to the laſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to ſpeak to on this Solemn Occaſion; firſt, Reſpecting Confeſſion of Sin; ſhewing your Exaltation above the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="xxxix" facs="tcp:65629:20"/> Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c. as at large in <hi>p.</hi> 221. of this Book; ſo that I need not repeat it. Now what Anſwer, <hi>George,</hi> doſt thou make to this? Doſt thou ſay, 'tis your Friends Practice to make Confeſſion of Sin to God in your Prayers? Not a word of it. Doſt thou prove in any one page of thoſe 5555555 I there mention, that you ever recommended the practice of making Confeſſion of Sin to God, and begging his Pardon for Chriſt's ſake? Not a word of it. Doſt thou prove out of any of thoſe Books, wrote by thy ſelf, <hi>Fox, Burroughs,</hi> &amp;c. that ever you recommended the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the Apoſtles Creed, either to be read in your Families, or in your Religious Meetings practiced; or the reading the Scripture in your Meetings? Not a word of it. No, here is no denial of Matter of Fact out of your Books, nor the natural Conſequences deduceable therefrom, or your practice agreeable to the ſame: And that it may appear ſo, take your Anſwer in your own words, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">Thus <hi>Fran. Bugg.</hi> repreſents me Preaching ſuch ſtuff as I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached in my Life, nor ever own'd any ſuch flattery or deceit, as to exalt any Auditory above the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to diſſwade any from making Confeſſion of Sin, or asking Pardon for Chriſt's ſake, who have
<pb n="xl" facs="tcp:65629:21"/> need of both, or who have not received forgiveneſs of their Sin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It's not what you did not diſſwade from, that we are examining; but what you perſwade to: We want not Negatives, but Affirmatives; here you leave your Reader in the Dark: Can you prove that in all thoſe Books and Pages recited, that you ever made Confeſſion of Sin; that you ever asked Pardon for Chriſt's ſake; that you in your Religious Meetings, or in your Families, practiced the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, the Apoſtles Creed; that you ever read the Holy Scriptures in your Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or further, that you ever in all, or any one of your Books, recommended the practice thereof? If not, the Charge lyes ſtill againſt you, and your Negative Anſwers rather confirm what is ſaid than otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>As to your Certificate, <hi>p.</hi> 28. about your Cottage; you that can forge Certificates, and ſet Mens Names to it, without their Privity, Knowledge or Conſent, as you did that from <hi>Huntington,</hi> in your Book, <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> as <hi>Anne Docwra,</hi> in her Letter to Mr. <hi>Criſp, March</hi> 25. 1684. ſays you did; what credit is to be given to it? And beſides, thoſe three Certifiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus, <hi>On credible Information, we verily Believe.</hi> Here then is but their belief on Information; and I am credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of what I wrote; ſo the Reader is left to believe as he is perſwaded. The like
<pb n="xli" facs="tcp:65629:21"/> may be ſaid of <hi>Will. Mead,</hi> touching his ſaying to <hi>William Harris,</hi> that <hi>Fox</hi>'s Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal is a better Book than the Bible; this <hi>Will. Mead</hi> does not deny under his Hand; I have only <hi>Geor. Whitehead</hi>'s word for it; and he that can forge Certificates is not to be believed.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 38. <q rend="inline">What Earnings didſt thou <hi>(F. B.)</hi> make in the late Diſcourſe before the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and the four Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Parliament, where I diſcovered thy repeated Falſhoods, Forgery, Deceit and Wickedneſs in divers Matters? And how thou wert counfounded when Matters were cloſely urg'd againſt thee? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>George,</hi> thou knoweſt in thy own Conſcience that this is a Lie ſpoken in Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, on purpoſe to miſlead thy Diſciples; for thou didſt not prove one falſe Quotation, Matter or Thing, againſt me: But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thee guilty of contempt of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in exalting your ſayings above them, as of greater Authority; and for the truth of this, I ſubmit my ſelf to thoſe Five Perſons preſent, one of them having often ſhewed his Approbation of my management of that Affair. Theſe things, <hi>George,</hi> do not redound to thy Credit, and I can truly ſay I am ſorry for thee. <hi>George,</hi> we both grow Ancient, let us write for the good of others, not for Victory; for my part, I do upon the word of a Chriſtian deſign it,
<pb n="xlii" facs="tcp:65629:22"/> and if I ſaw my ſelf in an Error, I ſhould willingly ſubmit. Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 46. <q rend="inline">Beſide the falſe Printing and bad Engliſh (as <hi>Fr. B.</hi> has expoſed my Book <hi>Iſhmael</hi>) there is another defect after the words [The Lake is thy Portion, which is the Portion of Liars,] the words, [ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thou ſpeedily repent;] are omitted there, and in ſome other places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Anſwer, let any body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your Book, <hi>Iſhmael and his Mother caſt out,</hi> &amp;c. in the Original Impreſſion in Quarto, and the Reprint in my <hi>Modeſt Deſence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Part</hi> 2. and they ſhall find it, for Engliſh, Comma's, and Points, and Words, the ſame. For in the Quarto Impreſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 15. there is <hi>we</hi> for <hi>wo,</hi> as in <hi>Mod. Def. p.</hi> 7. <hi>l.</hi> 13. there is alſo <hi>we</hi> for <hi>wo;</hi> and ſo in all other places where it was bad Engliſh, and falſe Spelled, and falſe Pointed, ſo it is Reprinted: And as for the words [except thou ſpeedily repent] being left out, I do poſitively ſay 'tis a moſt horrid Lie; there is not a word in the whole Book left out; ſo careful was I. And how then canſt thou pretend to be a Conſciencious Writer, when in the face of the Sun thou canſt thus Prevaricate, Diſſemble, and Lie, and that knowingly? What is become, <hi>George,</hi> of thy ſeriouſneſs, ſincerity and plainneſs thou ſo often boaſts of? Again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 34. <q rend="inline">He (<hi>F. B.</hi>) aſſumes the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to promote in Print an Abſtract of
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:65629:22"/> two Letters of two Clergymen; I <hi>pray God open the Eyes of our Governours, and cauſe them to take into Conſideration this too much, and too deplorable, unlimited and unbounded Tolleration; eſpecially as the Quakers both claim and uſe it,</hi> &amp;c. as in <hi>Pil. Prog. p.</hi> 175. was not this, (ſays <hi>George</hi>) a piece of inſolent confidence, to expoſe this in Print, and thus openly to oppoſe the Liberty Granted, and legally Confirmed by King and Parliament, and thus to render our Governours blinds? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as I think this was a good Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſo do I think it no boldneſs to expoſe it in Print: For, <hi>George,</hi> it was not the Liberty Granted, and by Law Confirmed, which theſe Clergymen either called unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited or unbounded, for the liberty granted is both limited and bounded, as from divers branches of the Laws appear; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the very Act of Tolleration; ſee <hi>p.</hi> 86, 88, 101, 189, 339. No, the unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Liberty which the Quakers take, claim and uſe, is what the Clergy is againſt, and which they Pray the Government would take into their Conſideration; and I am ſure it is a baſe, bold and inſolent thing, <hi>George,</hi> in you to expoſe in Print, that the Clergy would repreſent the King and Parliament blind: But I have not herein room to ſet forth your baſeneſs in calling all Kings <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Egyptians;</hi> all that own any King, ſince the days of Chriſt, <hi>Apoſtates;</hi> that Parliaments choſen by moſt Voices, <hi>are not
<pb n="xliv" facs="tcp:65629:23"/> like to Act for God, or the Good of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> that <hi>Parliaments are the Beaſt that carry the Whore;</hi> Nay, in your Book, <hi>The Weſt Anſwering to the North,</hi> &amp;c. you juſtifie the Murther of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. ſaying, <hi>The cutting off his Head, was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Record of the Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God;</hi> and for a true ſight of theſe your Antimonarchical, as well as Antimagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Principles, ſee <hi>p.</hi> 157. to <hi>p.</hi> 175. hereafter. And, <hi>George,</hi> you tell us in Print, that your Principles are now no other than they were in the beginning. And what they were in the beginning, I in this Book, the <hi>Pilg. Prog.</hi> &amp;c. have ſet forth: And I think it is both bold and inſolent Confidence in you to revive all theſe your horrid Principles deſtructive to Government and Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, by telling us you are the ſame in Principles ſtill; and I am afraid we may in this believe you.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhall ſhew, even thee, <hi>George,</hi> what Liberty the Quakers both uſe and claim; which not only thoſe two Clergymen, but many Ten Thouſands, both of Laity and Clergy, are againſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Your ſending into the Churches Challenges, as your Friends did at <hi>Weſt-Dereham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your going from Houſe to Houſe, like the Popiſh Prieſts, to ſeduce the People, inviting them to your Meetings, giving them Books which ſay the Quakers
<pb n="xlv" facs="tcp:65629:23"/> are the one only Church of Chriſt, and that out of your Church there is no Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That your Monthly, Quarterly, Six Week, Second Day, and Yearly Meetings, where you revive your old Treaſonable Principles; which Meetings are expreſly againſt the very Act of Tolleration, theſe, and the like, (as in the enſuing Diſcourſe) are the Meetings and the Practices both uſed and claim'd by you: Namely, to hold Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Eſtabliſhed Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Licence from His Majeſty, cannot legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do. Theſe, and the like Practices of yours, all good Chriſtians, and the Laws of the Land, are againſt; and I ſtill pray God to give the Nation a ſight and ſence of it, before it be too late.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to your 48th Page, I query thus, Whether it be not as proper for me to Addreſs His Majeſty, on the behalf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and other ſound Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who hold the Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, as it is for <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> to Addreſs himſelf, by Dedication, to the Clergy and Univerſities, perſonating a Schiſm which profeſſes ſuch Doctrine as tends to overthrow the Chriſtian Faith? Come, <hi>George,</hi> Anſwer me this Queſtion; how came you to be ſuch a Man? You know I could ſhew Books of your Friends, <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, Fiſher, Fox,</hi> and others, who tho' as great Impoſters as any in the World ever knew, yet they have Dedicated and
<pb n="xlvi" facs="tcp:65629:24"/> Addreſſed, and not only ſo, but Dictated to Kings, Lords and Commons. Come, <hi>G.</hi> what was your birth? Whence came your breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Were you not Rambling Pilgrims, who (like Gypſies) lay in Barns, lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Alms, with your Feet at other Mens Tables? <note place="margin">See <hi>E. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>'s Epiſt. to his works.</note> What, muſt none Addreſs now but you? Muſt none apply themſelves to the Government but you? Surely, <hi>George,</hi> you are a Pegg too high.</p>
            <p>Come, <hi>George,</hi> let us reaſon together, what power have you to ſummons all Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Courts and Officers, more than I have to ſummon you? What Power have you to Dialogue the Biſhops, and the whole Church, more than I have to Dialogue you? What Authority have you to Arraign, Try, Judge and Condemn all the Clergy in a Kingdom, more than I have to Arraign you, and Try you by your Fruit? I tell you, <hi>George,</hi> I cannot ſee you mount the Stage, and thus Inſult, Domineer and Exalt your ſelves, not only above the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apoſtles, Saints and Martyrs, and all Chriſtians, with reſpect to your ſo much boaſted-of Sinleſs Perfection, but above all the King's Subjects, as if you, and you only, had right to Addreſs, Dedicate and Preſent Papers to the Parliament; and that it were Treaſon to confront you: I tell you, as above noted, that you are a pegg too high.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>George,</hi> before you had Addreſt your ſelves, and Dedicated your Books to the King
<pb n="xlvii" facs="tcp:65629:24"/> and Government, you ought to have condemn'd your Books mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 154, 157, 167. And before you had Dedicated this Book to the Clergy, you ought in prudence to have retracted your Books mentioned <hi>p.</hi> 217, 249, 250. And as to <hi>G. K</hi>'s. Book, it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Quakers; and you ought to have retracted the Doctrine of it, as <hi>G. K.</hi> has; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s and <hi>Alexander Skien</hi>'s mentioned in <hi>p.</hi> 168, 170. But your Temporizing is both ſeen, and diſcovered to be ſeen by others: And now for your Dedication to the Clergy.</p>
            <p>A Rambling Pilgrim, <hi>p.</hi> 3. <hi>An Epiſtle Dedicatory to thoſe of the Clergy, and of the two Univerſities, whoſe kindneſs</hi> Fran. Bugg <hi>boaſts of.</hi> 30<hi>th of the</hi> 4<hi>th Month,</hi> 1629. <hi>By</hi> George Whitehead.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>George,</hi> to ſhew you what a kind Reception your Dedication met with from my Benefactors; I ſhall, though I have no order, preſent you with part of a Letter which one of them ſent me; which take as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>I Cannot but thank you for the ſervice you have done, eſpecially among the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by your way of Writing; and for the plentiful materials you have furniſh'd out, to imploy others, with reſpect both to the Principles and Practices of the Quakers; and your laborious Attendance at Parliament, as a Check to the Inſolencies of the Quakers in their preſenting their deceivable Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, in which they have been too much neglected; wherefore be not diſhearten'd, but go on, and Charge the Quakers Party through and through with their Blaſphemies againſt the Bleſſed Trinity, their Doctrine of Infallibility and Sinleſs Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their denying the Fundamental Articles of our moſt Holy Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Incarnation of Chriſt, the Reſurrection of the Body, and the Day of Judgment. For to talk of Lenitives, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="xlviii" facs="tcp:65629:25"/> Applications, is like the old way of ſowing Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows under their Arm-holes; and you may as well give Opium in a Lethargy, as to fancy to cure ſome Men into their Senſes by your mild and tender Remedies: And therefore to deal plainly is the beſt way to work their Converſion, from the Infidelity of Quakeriſm, to the Faith of Chriſt Crucified; which God of his Mercy grant them, if it be his Will.</p>
                  <p>It was a notable Confeſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he drew up an Indictment, and Arraigned himſelf in the Murther of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> for his ſtanding by and conſenting unto his Death, and holding the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them that ſlew him. I wiſh the Quakers were Humble enough to follow his Example; whoſe malice I am afraid is greater, and the dignity of the injured Perſon higher; for they have Spirited away our Bleſſed Saviour, and have left us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a Notional and Chimerical Chriſt; ſo that we may take up the Lamentation of <hi>Mary Magdalen, They have taken away the Lord, and we know not where they have laid him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That was well noted in the <hi>Spirit of the Hat:</hi> For I am perſwaded there cannot be an Inſtance made in any Society of Men of that bigneſs, that have gotten more Baſtards, and more unnaturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of them, that have drank deeper Draughts of ſtoln ſecret Intemperance, that have fed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and fared more deliciouſly every Day, than have ſome of theſe Perfectioniſts in their ſhining brazen diſguiſes of Religion.</p>
                  <p>I am heartily ſorry for the poor Quaker, I heard lately of, who hanged himſelf <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>viz. Will. Ruſt,</hi> a Preacher at <hi>Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <hi>G. K.</hi>

            <p>I remember well St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13. who ſaid, <hi>Evil Men and Seducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving, and being deceived;</hi> and thereupon, like a Careful Watchman over the Church of God, over which the Holy Ghoſt had made him an Overſeer, he then, and by his Doctrine now, cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons all Believers in the True God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That we be henceforth no more Children toſſed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine, whereby they lye in wait to deceive.</hi> And wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Son <hi>Titus,</hi> Chap. 1. Ver. 12, 13. he there does moſt
<pb n="l" facs="tcp:65629:26"/> Excellently deſcribe the <hi>Cretians</hi> from a Teſtimony of one of their own Prophets or Teachers, who, like your Teachers, were always Liars and Diſſemblers; and therefore he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Titus</hi> to reprove them ſharply; and indeed it is the only way to work a Cure: And this is according to the Doctrine of <hi>Tho. Ellwood,</hi> one of your own Prophets or Teachers, ſaying, <hi>The only way to recover the deceived, is to diſcover the Deceivers. This Witneſs is true,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Cretian</hi> Poet; and thereupon I have for many Years laboured to diſcover your Teachers; and if you will but ſearch diligently, read and judge impartially, you may ſee for your ſelves, whether theſe things be ſo or no. It's true, I have expoſed ſome of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities of a few of your Teachers, but it is for a good End, namely, that by your ſeeing them, and conſidering their high Pretences to Infallibility, and a Sinleſs Perfection, you may be admoniſhed to a Confeſſion of your Sins to God, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardon for Jeſus Chriſt's Sake, that God may keep and bleſs and preſerve you to his Heavenly Kingdom, to Reign with Chriſt for Ever and Ever.</p>
            <p>You may further obſerve, that <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Rambling. Pilgrim, &amp;c.</hi> has not denied one Quotation, yet by a Cunning of his, would repreſent me a Forger; but that will ſoon vaniſh, when you conſider that in all Dialogues the like li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is taken<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>S. Eccles</hi> Dialogue, <hi>Fox</hi>'s and <hi>Smith</hi>'s.</note>: And I can Appeal to God the Searcher of all Hearts, that my Chief End why I ſo expos'd them, was (after long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing) to let them ſee themſelves, and learn not to inſult over others: And as it has had a good Effect upon ſome, ſo I hope it will upon others: And ſo I conclude with my hearty Prayer to God, that of his Infinite Goodneſs he would vouchſafe a Bleſſing upon my Labours, to the Benefit of you and your Poſterity, whoſe Information I have taken great Pains in, that you might not continue in Ignorance, and be led by your Blind Guides into the Ditch of Error and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</p>

               <p>THE firſt of theſe Books is Intitled, <hi>A Juſt Cenſure of</hi> Francis Bugg<hi>'s Addreſs to the Parliament:</hi> This ſhews their Impudence, or want of good Manners at leaſt; had they Confuted my Arguments, or Convicted me of one Falſe Quotation, thereby to Miſrepreſent them, they, in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to themſelves, might have Confuted what was Falſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Fact or Argument: But, not being able ſo to do, for them, in a Magiſterial way, to Cenſure my Speech to the Parliament, and Addreſs to my Superiors, for which I have (as an Engliſhman) as good Right as they, and every way equally Priviledged with them, this was in them both Bold and Preſumptuous, as well as want of Wiſdom, not to ſtay their Cenſure until the Parliament had paſt theirs, whoſe Right it was, if they had ſeen Cauſe, and to whom I ought to have ſubmitted, as in Duty bound; but no Symptoms of that did appear, but <hi>Pride</hi> (as it is written) <hi>goeth before Deſtruction, and a Haughty Mind before a Fall.</hi> And as it is impoſſible for a Blacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moor to change his Skin, or a Leopard his Spots, ſo is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the Quakers to ceaſe their Inſulting and Domineer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Method; as if they may preſent their Books and Papers Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years together, and none may Confront them.</p>
               <p>They begin with the Man; he has angred them, by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Errors and Blaſphemies; they go on with Perſonal Reflections againſt him, which affects not the Cauſe, and which he has long ſince repeatedly Anſwer'd in Print; but ſtill the Man, the Man, he is an Ill Man, ſay they; what! Worſe than the Quaker Teachers? No ſure; for if he were, believe me, he were an Ill Man indeed; for I think there is not worſe than ſome of them are, and have been, even in <hi>Newgate,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="lii" facs="tcp:65629:27"/> their high pretence to a Sinleſs Perfection, and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of Judgment; many of whom have been highly guilty of Cheating, Couzening, Lying and Defrauding, of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Whoredom, Felony, and Treaſon, Condemn'd both by the Law of God and Man; and ſome of them Hang'd for their Juſt Merit; ſome Inſtances you will find in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. p. 266, to p. 284. p. 329. <hi>ibid.</hi> And as I find no Name to the Books, ſo I find no denial of Matter of Fact to <hi>Mod. Def. Nihil dicit</hi> is Confeſſing of Judgment, and I ſhall wait patiently to ſee the Execution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I ſhall ſay the leſs in Anſwer to it, ſince as it plainly appears, that the Quakers does not deny Matter of Fact, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in truth they could not; ſo will their Silence be taken for a tacit Confeſſion of the Charge.</p>
               <p>But ſay they, p. 40. <hi>For as we cannot quit any Point of our own [Books] ſo we abhor every one of them as given by him,</hi> [Fran. Bugg]. The Engliſh of which is, They cannot quit any one Error, any one Blaſphemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their own Books, tho' they abhor them in my Books; that is, of my Reciting, of my Tranſcribing, of my Reprinting; Oh! this they abhor with great deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And why? Becauſe I ſeldom do it without uſing ſome Arguments to diſcover their Hypocriſies; this, yea, this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages them; for this they are angry: And therefore I would deſire the Quakers to Reprint <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Book, <hi>Iſhmael and his Mother caſt out, &amp;c.</hi> where in p. 10. is this paſſage, <hi>viz. And here thy Antiquity, and thy Reaſons, and the Three Perſons which thou Dreams of, which thou [i. e.</hi> Mr. <hi>Townſend</hi> the Miniſter] <hi>would divide out of one like a Conjurer, are</hi> ALL <hi>denied, and thou</hi> SHUT UP <hi>with</hi> THEM <hi>in</hi> PERPETUAL DARKNESS <hi>for the</hi> LAKE <hi>and the</hi> PIT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This indeed is their Ancient Principles, and they cannot quit them, or retract them in their own Books, but tell us their Principles are now no other than they were then, only they can word the Matter otherwiſe: I grant they hate, abhor and deteſt theſe things of my reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as they lye ſnug in their own Books, they read them in their own Meetings; they are ſweet Morſels of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Conſolation; read <hi>A Modeſt Defence, &amp;c.</hi> Part II. p. 22. for more of this, where I have Reprinted their whole Book <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, &amp;c.</hi> to avoid their Cavils of Curtailing and Splitting Sentences, as well as to ſhew Quakeriſm in its Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion.</p>

               <p>In their <hi>Sober Reply, &amp;c.</hi> p. 11, 14, 15. in Anſwer to the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Petition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſay, <hi>To the firſt we ſay, It is ſtrange you ſhould fear the Chriſtian Religion ſhould be polluted by the Quakers, who, of all that go under the Proteſtant Name, are generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be furtheſt removed from, and moſt averſe to Popiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition — ſo we always offer our Doctrines and Principles to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Scriptures.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>If it be to ſwim through a Sea of Blood, only to deſire that the Quakers Errors and Blaſphemous Principles, (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Scriptures, deny that Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> who ſuffered on the Croſs to be the Son of God, and damn to the Pit of Hell the Ever-bleſſed Trinity) ſhould lye Cenſured and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and their Books, that ſo teach, Burnt by the Common Hangman, then indeed they are guilty: But if this be not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, but agreeable to the Law of the Land, the Votes of Parliament, His Majeſties Royal Will and Pleaſure declared in his Proclamation, then they are not guilty of Perſecution, nor of running through a Sea of Innocent Blood in the Defence of Chriſtianity, as the Quakers would impoſe upon their Readers, to avoid the dint of an Examination, notwithſtanding their pretence. <hi>A Reply,</hi> &amp;c. p. 11. <hi>We are ready to undertake the Proof of every Doctrine we hold by and from the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have read in St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epiſtle, that as in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he exhorts us to contend earneſtly for the Faith which <hi>was</hi> once delivered to the Saints, <hi>ſo, ver.</hi> 9. <hi>That</hi> Michael <hi>the Archangel when contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Devil, he diſputed about the Body of</hi> Moſes, <hi>durſt not bring againſt him a Railing Accuſation, but ſaid, The Lord rebuke thee.</hi> And now I am Diſputing with the Quakers, his chiefeſt Emiſſaries, and immediate Servants, I hope I ſhall not bring a Railing Accuſation: But as it is Natural for a Worm when trodden upon to turn again, and for an Engliſhman to ſet the Saddle on the right Horſe, ſo I hope I ſhall as long as Life laſt, eſpecially when St. <hi>Jude</hi> has ſo rightly deſcribed the Men, as <hi>ver.</hi> 8. ſaying, <hi>Likewiſe alſo theſe filthy Dreamers defile the Fleſh, deſpiſe Dominions, and ſpeak evil of Dignities,</hi> as I have ſhewed in my <hi>Modeſt Defence,</hi> &amp;c. Part I. p. 10, 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>But ſay they, <hi>A Juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. p. 1, 2. <hi>The Man — he and his Abetters are ill Men.</hi> P. 11. <hi>It were greatly to be wiſhed, that theſe Zealots would turn their Spleen against Sin — what fair Quarter all ſorts of Enormities meet with from ſome of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that none allow fairer Quarter to Vice and Immorality than the Quakers, and Leaders of the Quaker Church, is plain. See <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. p. 244, to p. 284. And one Reaſon I take to be is their own Guilt, which would make their Reproofs ſound like the Kettle calling the Pot Black-A—; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the Inconſideration of their Hearers that ſupports the Credit of ſuch Vicious Hypocrites, who are upheld by their Character rather than their Vertue, and are become much leſs loved than feared; for I demand an Inſtance of any one Book
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:65629:28"/> wrote againſt their Vicious Teachers and Hearers, provided they keep <hi>Fox</hi>'s Commandments about the Hat, Thee, Thou, not Marrying or Burying with us, and the like unwritten Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; but I can give you an Account of Hundreds of Books wrote againſt ſuch as diſſent from them, and conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> calling them Apoſtates, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> Malicious Informers, Renegadoes, Beaſts, Dogs, Wolves, Children of the Devil, Enemies of all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Devils Incarnate, and a Hundred other Names. And they call the Publick Miniſtry, for endeavouring their Converſion, Witches, Devils, Thieves, Robbers, Antichriſts, the Bane of Soul and Body, threatning them with all direful Vengeance; and this, if rightly conſidered, is not the leaſt part of their Inſolent Behaviour to the Government.</p>
               <p>Now whether your <hi>Juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. was in Anſwer to my former Sheet, with a Scheme of your Yearly Meeting; or to my <hi>Modeſt Reply,</hi> &amp;c. or both, ſince 'tis ſaid to be a Juſt Cenſure of my Addreſs to the Parliament, and I preſented none under that Title, I will not determine, ſince it ſeems to the firſt, tho' given in ſince my laſt; yet I cannot but admire at your Impudence in your <hi>Reply,</hi> &amp;c. in Anſwer to my <hi>Modeſt Defence,</hi> where you ſay, p. 7. <hi>But ſure we are, and always ready to make it appear, that neither are our Books Blaſphemous, nor our Principles Pernicious.</hi> Again, p. 11. <hi>We are ready to undertake the Proof of every Doctrine we hold by and from the Scriptures;</hi> this is Falſe in Fact, and a Notorious Lie in the Face of the Government. Firſt, In that you knew I had preſented to the Parliament the Reprint of an entire Book of yours, ſtiled, <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> &amp;c. which is both pernicious to the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, and horridly Blaſphemous. Secondly, In refuſing to prove any one Doctrine you held at <hi>Weſt Dereham.</hi> Thirdly, In refuſing to meet <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> upon any of his Invitations.</p>
               <p>Again, p. 10. <hi>We ſincerely own all that is written in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concerning Chriſt, reſpecting his Conception, Birth, Life, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Doctrines, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Mediation, and Future Coming to Judgment,</hi> when in reality you own not one of thoſe Articles rightly, nor as all Orthodox Chriſtians own them, as <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s 4th Narrative, has from your Books made evidently to appear.</p>
               <p>Again, p. 6. <hi>ibid. That we aſſume Rules of Diſcipline in Church Matters, they are for our ſelves only, Powers in Matters of Religion, for and among our ſelves only. Nor</hi> (ſay they) <hi>do we ſee how thoſe
<pb n="lvi" facs="tcp:65629:29"/> Acts could be truly called Acts of Toleration to Diſſenters, if they did not tolerate each ſort of Diſſenters, to aſſume Rules of Diſcipline, Power in Matters of Religion, and Forms of Church Government for and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. Again, p. 11. <hi>And if it relate to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Performances,</hi> as it ſeems to do by the next words, <hi>i. e. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it is plain, that theſe Monthly, Quarterly, and Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meetings, then when it ſuit their turn they own to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Meetings, and as ſuch tolerated by the Act of Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and without allowing them, the Act could not be called <hi>An Act of Toleration:</hi> Yet to ſhew that Liars had need to have good Memories, they, in Contradiction to themſelves, when pinched from another Quarter for keeping their Doors Lock'd, Barr'd, or Guarded, to prevent Inſpection, they in their <hi>Juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. p. 26. confeſs, ſaying, <hi>Theſe Meetings are not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Worſhip;</hi> what then? What? For Government, and to aſſume Rules of Diſcipline, and Forms of Church Government, which is more than the Eſtabliſh'd Church can legally do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out His Majeſties Licence, and therefore worſe and more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, their Doors being kept Lock'd or Guarded; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt the very Act of Toleration, in which is this Clauſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Provided always, and be it Enacted by the Authority aforeſaid, That if any Aſſembly of Perſons, Diſſenting from the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſhall be had in any place for Religious Worſhip, <hi>[and ſuch only the Act tolerates]</hi> with Doors Lock'd, Barr'd, or Bolted, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any time of ſuch meeting together, all and every ſuch Perſon or Perſons, that ſhall come to, and be at, ſuch Meeting, ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Benefit from this Law, but be liable to all the Pains and Penalties of all the aforeſaid Laws recited in this Act, for ſuch their Meeting, notwithſtanding his taking the Oaths, and his making and ſubſcribing the Declaration.</q>
               <p>And likewiſe, as the Learned in the Law ſay, Such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Doors Lock'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to aſſume Rules of Diſcipline, and Forms of Church Government, are expreſly againſt the Rights of Parliaments, the King's Prerogative, and Liberty of the Subject, and theſe Statutes following, <hi>viz.</hi> 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19, 21. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 15. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 17. 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 10, 11. 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 12. 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. c. 2. 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. 1 K. <hi>W.</hi> &amp; Q. <hi>M.

<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:65629:29"/> themſelves into a Premunire: But the Quakers being a united Confederacy, a Body Politick Incorporated, and having a Fund or Common Bank to ſupport and propagate their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they are too powerful for any ſingle Perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Government is prayed to take it into their Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And that theſe Meetings are not within the Act of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration, but obnoxious to the Laws, and of a dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, I have more fully ſhewn in my <hi>Pilgrim's Progreſs from Quakeriſm to Christianity,</hi> &amp;c. 2d Edit. in <hi>Octavo,</hi> wherein I have more largely ſet forth their Monthly, Quarterly, Second-day, Six-week and Yearly Meetings, ſhewing they are not only for Government, as themſelves now confeſs, but a Government <hi>Imperium in Imperio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But one thing I cannot but obſerve in theſe Meek, Harmleſs Quakers, <hi>viz.</hi> in their repreſenting the Juſtices, Grand Juries, and Burgeſſes of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> as a Bloody-minded ſort of Tyrants, and that to the Right Honourable and Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, then no wonder they treat me at that diſdainful rate they do, and the Reverend Clergy for my ſake; but as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, Thanks be to God, the Proteſtant Magiſtrates, and the Epiſcopal Clergy, have been a Bulwark againſt Popery, ſo I truſt they will againſt the prevalency of Quakeriſm, and the danger of them, which ſeems to threaten both them and the Nation. <hi>A juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. p. 12. <hi>And conſider,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>whether it was decent in the Aldermen and Burgeſſes of</hi> Bury, <hi>&amp;c. thus to Impeach the Wiſdom and Conduct of the Government.</hi> P. 13. <hi>That all thoſe high Charges in the Petition exhibited againſt us, are grounded but upon their own groundleſs Jealouſies; they (how manner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (ſay they) <hi>let others judge) offer the Parliament</hi> Hobſon<hi>'s Choice, — cut our Throats, or knock out our Brains.

But, Friend, there is another thing in which I would be ſatisfied, namely, your anſwering Books, wherein you falſifie the Text, drop Words, ſplit Sentences, and marr the Sence of your Opponant's Argument; I will give you but one Inſtance in a Sheet preſented to the Parliament by <hi>Fra.

Reaſon 6. <hi>In one ſort of their Books they pretend to Love, Own, and Honour the King, yea, to Pray for all Men, for Kings, and all that are in Authority; but in their contrary ſort of Books they tell you, That</hi> all Kings <hi>and</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors <hi>ſprung up in the Night ſince the Days of the Apoſtles, among the</hi> Antichriſts; <hi>that they own</hi> no King, <hi>but</hi> Jeſus; <hi>nor no</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>but the Government of the</hi> Lamb; <hi>that they are Traytors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt that deſire an Earthly King: Do you read</hi> (ſay the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) <hi>that there were any Kings ſince the Days of the Apoſtles, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the</hi> Apoſtate Chriſtians? <hi>That Kings are the</hi> Spiritual Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians — <hi>Oh what a Sincerity was once in the Nation! What a</hi> dirty naſty <hi>thing it would have been to have heard talk of a Houſe of Lords among them? — A Parliament choſen by moſt Voices are not like to act for God, and the good of his People. — It was thorow Ignorance that the People ſubjected themſelves to Hereditary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the Government ſtanding in a ſingle Perſon ſucceſſively;
<pb n="lxi" facs="tcp:65629:31"/> — and our Nation have been under Bondage on this Account.</hi> Now all that the Quakers in their <hi>Juſt Cenſure,</hi> &amp;c. p. 18. recite, is as followeth, <hi>viz. In one ſort of our Books we ſeem to Own, Love, and Honour the King, yea, to Pray for all Men, for Kings, and all that are in Authority; but in the other ſort of our Books we tell People, that Kings and Emperors ſprung up in the Night, and among Apostate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi> and that we are againſt the Engliſh Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now how ſhort and defective they are herein, is obvious by comparing each.</p>

                  <p>Friends Intentions are good, they mean well, and can now word their Matter otherwiſe, and yet mean the ſame thing; for our Principles are now no other than they were in the beginning: And by Reaſon thereof, and that we cannot quit our Infallibility, ſome that went from us, throw in their Bombs amongſt us, which doth fearfully annoy us, and have ſplit our Main-maſt of Infallibility, and broken the Helm of our Sinleſs Perfection.</p>

                  <p>Now, Friend <hi>Jacob,</hi> it grows late, I cannot ſtay, I ſhall only ſum up a few Obſervations from the Premiſes, and then take my leave of you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to <hi>F. B.</hi> whether he has New Cloaths, or not, what he had left when his Horſe, and Pocket-money for his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was diſcounted, make nothing to the purpoſe; he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as great a proof that he has not been Mercenary, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 16 or 18 Years together againſt you without Money, as any Quaker can give.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Leaders are very Sawcy to meddle with the Biſhops Certificate, as in any thing you have attempted: Suppoſe he had been miſtaken in the Man, he did not ſay he gave it forth from the Eternal Infallible Spirit of God; he only ſaid <hi>he had known him ſome Years,</hi> this you do not diſprove; <hi>That he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him to be an Honeſt, Sober, Induſtrious Man,</hi> this might be for ought you either ſay or know; and if he had been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he does not pretend to know the Heart, nor to diſcern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who are Apoſtates, as the Quakers do; and if he had been miſtaken, it had been no more than ſome of your Teachers have been: <hi>That he had taken much Pains to Undeceive and Convert the Quakers, by publiſhing uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Books, and not without Succeſs,</hi> this he might ſafely ſay, for it was true in Fact; for at that time Mr. <hi>Rands,</hi> his Wife, and others that had left the Quakers, declared to ſome, that his Book, <hi>The Painted Harlot Stript and Whipt,</hi> &amp;c. was inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="lxii" facs="tcp:65629:32"/> therein; and ſince that, many others are come off who have acknowledged as much. <hi>And that by the Hardneſs of Times, Charge of Printing, he was reduced,</hi> &amp;c. this was true in Fact; <hi>wherefore</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I apprehend him a Real Object of Charity, and that he does truly deſerve the Bounty of well-diſpoſed Perſons, unto whom I recommend him;</hi> what hurt is in all this? And what had your Friends to do with it? May you hold a Yearly Meeting with Doors Lock'd, iſſue out your Epiſtles for Money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your Friends, as you ſay; and may not a Biſhop of the Eſtabliſhed Church recommend one of their Members to well-diſpoſed Perſons of the ſame Communion, without your Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Can you not be content to Cenſure the Acts of Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Grand Juries, and Juſtices, but muſt your Boldneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Expoſing and Cenſuring the Biſhops; I think you are a Peg too high.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas they pretend to undertake the proof of every Doctrine they hold, this appears to be a Lie told in Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: Let them Confute the Six Articles above exhibited, and Defend themſelves from the Ten Inſtances wherein they are Charged to be one in Doctrine with the Romiſh Church: Let them Anſwer <hi>F. B</hi>'s Seventy Queries, or elſe it will be taken <hi>pro Confeſſo,</hi> and that they are never able to clear themſelves from being guilty of Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Contempt of God's Word, and an Hundred other groſs and vile Errors.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>Oliver</hi>'s time then the Clergy put in Books into the Parliaments Hands, and it was your Buſineſs to Anſwer, and but reaſonable you ſhould defend your ſelves; and that the Government ſhould hear both ſides; this Priviledge none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd you: But now you put Books into their Hands not only in Seſſions time, but ſend them the Nation round to their Houſes in the interval of Parliaments, and <hi>F. Bugg</hi> Anſwers them, and preſents them in Seſſions time; this now you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear, this angers you, and you fall upon the Man; the Man is an Ill Man, the Man is Contentious, the Man is Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſom, the Man is an Apoſtate, a Renegado; this I tell you is very Bold and Imperious in your Teachers, that ſuch as forſake your Hereſie, and conform to the Eſtabliſht Religion, are by you Cenſured Apoſtates and Renegadoes; this highly reflects upon the Government, and by implication Charges the King and Parliaments Religion to be Heathen: For it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accounted that ſuch as forſook the Heathen Worſhip, and imbraced the Chriſtian Faith, were Converts; and that
<pb n="lxiii" facs="tcp:65629:32"/> ſuch as forſook the Chriſtian Religion, and imbraced Heathen Idolatry, (as ſome did formerly as well as now) were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates and Renegadoes; now by your Quakers Doctrine, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is Heathen, and you Chriſtian; how then have you the Face to appear to ſuch as humble Suiters, and with ſuch Books too, as tell them, by implication at leaſt, that they are a Heathen Parliament, and that ſuch as forſake the Quakers, and go to Church with the Parliament, are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, Renegadoes? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In their <hi>Just Cenſure,</hi> p. 40. they tell us, <hi>We are ſatisfied that it is no other Atteſtation than he has Collected out of our old Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Books,</hi> &amp;c. this <hi>F. B.</hi> denies, he took not a word of it out of their Adverſaries Books.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nor does he believe they are able to produce a Letter of the Late Lord Archbiſhop's, to clear <hi>W. Penn</hi> from the general belief that he is a J—t; but if they could, 'tis not one Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Evidence will do it, ſince ſome of the very ſame Order has confirmed that Opinion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If your Teachers be ready, as they boaſt, to prove every Doctrine they hold, let them appoint Time and Place, and <hi>G. Keith</hi> and <hi>F. Bugg</hi> will not only meet them, but prove the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Charge upon them; if not, I will be one that ſhall deſire they may be ſet in the Pillory for Examples, on Condition the Quakers will be obliged, if they do, that they'll retract their Errors; this to be ſure is no Perſecution, tho' the only thing they fear; and all in ſupport of their great Idol In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, and Sinleſs Perfection.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But if they refuſe this, it will appear that your Teachers, Friend <hi>Jacob,</hi> are great Prevaricators, impudent Liars, horrible Deceivers, great Impoſtors, wicked Blaſphemers, and groſs Idolaters, Subverters of Laws, Religion, and that their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples improved, are deſtructive to all Mankind.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And therefore, Friend <hi>Jacob,</hi> there is not only Bombs ſent into your Camp, but there is a whole Broadſide given, which will ſhake your Strong Hold: That is to ſay, by two Books, the one by <hi>Fra. Bugg,</hi> Intitled, <hi>The Pilgrim's Progreſs,</hi> &amp;c. which ſhews, that your Monthly, Quarterly, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Six-week Meetings are nor for Worſhip, as you now confeſs, but for Government, and that that Government is contrary to all the Laws above recited; the other by <hi>Geo. Keith,</hi> Intitled, <hi>The Fourth Narrative of Proceedings at</hi> Turners-Hall,
<pb n="lxiv" facs="tcp:65629:33"/> ſhewing that your Principles are deſtructive to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and tend to overthrow the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. And I am glad to ſee you thus purſued, and for your own good too, in hopes that our Government will find a time to Examin theſe things, and prevent your walking in Maſquerade, as well as your deep Deſign to ſupplant Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And I am willing further to obſerve, that as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> has been a Check upon you, ſo has he been uſeful in keeping on foot the Petition till a Convenient Seaſon; as alſo in Anſwering your Books, by which you Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Grand Juries, the Corporations, and the Juſtices of Peace, which will be no ſmall Motive to the Proſecution now in hand.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Not that I believe or deſire Perſecution will enſue; no. I am not for puniſhing the Swearers and Damners of the Age with Cutting their Throats, or a Sea of Blood; but that as God permits them to Live, ſo the Nation ſuffers them, tho' not tolerated by an Act of Indulgence; no more 'tis hoped will you in your Blaſphemous Errors and Pernicious Principles, unleſs you do heartily and ſincerely retract them, and thereby make ſome Atonement for the great Scandal you have been to the Reformed Religion; and ſo Adieu.</p>

                  <p>Giving an Account of my Education in the Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith; and how I came to Apoſtatize from it, and fall in with the Schiſm of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Was Born at <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> on the 10th Day of <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1640. and Baptized into the Church of Chriſt, the 14th of the ſame Month; promiſing then by my Sureties, to Fight manfully under Chriſt's Banner. My Father's Name was <hi>Robert Bugg,</hi> ſecond Son
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65629:34"/> of <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> (and <hi>Margaret</hi> his Wife,) who was Chief Conſtable many Years; my Mother's Name was <hi>Joan,</hi> the Fourth and Youngeſt Daughter of <hi>Thomas Holman,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, (who was Baptized the 16th Day of <hi>March,</hi> 1619.) living at <hi>Lakenheath-Hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> My Parents were of a good Yeomen-Family, and lived in good Repute, and brought me up in the Profeſſion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and when I came to Years, capable of Inſtruction, they Taught me the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles Creed;</hi> and very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere they were, in Teaching me the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Chriſtian Religion. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Mother, who was a very good and pious Woman, and religiouſly inclined, would not ſuffer me to Sleep, when I went to Bed, e're I had ſaid my Prayers, and ſometimes, part of my Catechiſm: And on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> ſhe made me to frequent the Church, and at Home on that Day, as well as moſt other Days, to read ſome Portion of the Holy Scriptures: They brought me up to School Learning, until I attained to the Age of about Fifteen Years, whereby I was capable to Write, and Read <hi>Engliſh</hi> very well; as alſo to caſt Accompt, few Lads went beyond me: As alſo the <hi>Grammar,</hi> wherein I was well inſtructed in the Rules thereof, inſomuch, that I began to make a Piece of <hi>Latin;</hi> but my Father living in a great Farm at <hi>Undley-Hall,</hi> in the Pariſh of

                  <hi>Lakenheath,</hi> of 200 <hi>l.</hi> a Year; beſides a <hi>Fen-Farm</hi> in his Hands, of 100 <hi>l. per.

               <p>I muſt alſo confeſs, I was in my Youth inclined to Company, eſpecially to Dancing and Muſick; yet I had in my early Years a Love to Religion, and delighted much in Reading the Holy Scriptures, ſometimes Eight or Ten Chapters together, I alſo lov'd much to hear good Preachers. I very well remember, that ſometimes I went to <hi>Milden-Hall,</hi> (where we formerly liv'd,) on the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> on purpoſe to hear Mr. <hi>Watſon,</hi> who was accounted a famous Preacher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Four Miles from my Dwelling. Thus much briefly touching my early Education.</p>

                     <hi>REader,</hi> I am the more particular in theſe Remarks, for that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> [how much ſoever I was in eſteem, whilſt with them] ſince I left them, have traduced me, and laid all the Reproaches on me which Malice can invent, <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                  <p>An Account of my Apoſtacy; and how I came to be carried away by the <hi>Quakers</hi> Diſſimulation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ABout the Year of our Lord 1657, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Symonds,</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> came to <hi>Lakenheath,</hi> and appointed Meetings; and many <hi>Quakers</hi> came from <hi>Thetford,</hi> and other Places: And, tho' I went to Church on the Forenoon, yet I had itching Ears to hear the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and my Mother being dead, and much of my Reſtraint thereby ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, I went to their Meetings in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, and gave great heed to what was ſpoken; whoſe chief Subject was, <hi>The Light within every Man,</hi> and this Light to be Chriſt: And their great Argument was from Chriſt's telling the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> her Thoughts, ſaying, <hi>Come, ſee a Man which told me all things that ever I did; is not this the Chriſt?</hi> &amp;c. John 4.29. Therefore, ſaid the <hi>Quakers,</hi> this <hi>Light within</hi> muſt needs be the Man Chriſt, and no other Man Chriſt, do they now own to this Day, if they would ſpeak their Thoughts: However, their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings prove it; and till they condemn them, all they alledge to the contrary is nothing worth.</p>
               <p>Well, however, I and others were catched by theſe and the like fallacious Arguments,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65629:36"/> not being well grounded in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, nor underſtanding the Wiles of Satan; and by their ſmooth and fair Carriage, by their ſuffering patiently the Affronts they then met with. And I cannot but ſtill remember, how our Miniſter warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us of the Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and told us, they were Deceivers and Antichriſts; even thoſe Deceivers which Chriſt foretold us ſhould ariſe, ſhewing Signs and Wonders; inſomuch, that if it were poſſible, they ſhould deceive the very Elect, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Which I now alſo believe.</note> But by this their pretended Patience in Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, by their ſo much inſiſting on the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of our Conſciences, which prompts to Good, and checks for ſome Evils; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fair Words, and ſeeming, nay, real Truths, with which they covered over their poyſonous Pills of Schiſm and Hereſie, many of us were deceived.</p>
               <p>Again, when I ſaw ſo much Plainneſs and ſeeming Sincerity in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, how our Miniſter lived, it was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Motive to induce me to go after the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for our Miniſter lived with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I do think ſome Years; my Father was the chief Man that got him into the Place: But, both then, and afterwards, he was ſuch, not ſo exemplary as he ought to have been, and I not being capable to judge of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal Part, I was carried away in my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; being more apt to be led by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than Precept, which is not always ſafe:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65629:36"/> However, I do believe it was the offenſive Practice of our Miniſter, which I beheld in divers Particulars, which was one Cauſe of my Stumbling, whereby I fell unhappily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Schiſm. Not that I now judge the Occaſion by him given, was or is warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Separation from an Eſtabliſhed Church.</p>

                  <p>NOW therefore, I intreat all concerned in the Miniſterial Office, as Paſtors, That they beware they give no ill Example to their Flock, contrary to what becomes their Sacred Function; but, when they Preach well, let them Practice ſo, as believing what they ſay, ſo will their People believe them to be in earneſt. But, if they Preach never ſo Orthodoxly, and tho' their Sermons be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much Learned, yet if they do not live in ſome tolerable ſort anſwerably, their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will Queſtion, Whether they believe what they teach; and, as a Conſequence thereof, will take that Liberty in Living, which is not becoming Chriſtians: Or elſe, if Seducers come, will be apt to ſeparate themſelves, in Hopes to get under a purer Miniſtry; which, when they come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to examine, they may find it to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Shew.

               <argument>
                  <p>Gives an Account of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Silent Meetings, and the Tendency of them: In which, I ſhall ſpeak ſometimes in the Perſon of a <hi>Quaker,</hi> reſpecting the time I was one.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving by this time fallen in with the <hi>Quakers;</hi> in a few Years, I became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry zealous that way, and to Silent Meetings I went; and ſometimes we had a few Words ſpoken, ſometimes none; ſometime an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s, <hi>George Fox</hi>'s, <hi>Sam. Cater</hi>'s, or ſome others, read in our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſometimes none: But the chief of what we did hear, either from our inſpired Infallible Teachers, or from our Friends Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, in thoſe private Silent Meetings, was, To exhort us to wait in the Light, out of our Selves, out of our Thoughts, out of our Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Runnings, in that which is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and then we ſhould receive the hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> yea, <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, which the World knew not of; and that we ſhould feel Chriſt to come the ſecond time to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that Judgment was to begin at the Houſe of God, which Houſe was our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: And from hence divers of us fell oft into a Trembling and Shaking. I have ſeen about five or ſix together in a Meeting, ſhake
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65629:37"/> like a Leaf in Winter, namely, <hi>Matthew Beeſly, Jonas Skrook, William Eyſon,</hi> and others; yea, they have ſhaken the Forms they ſat on; and this, not once, nor twice, but frequently. I do very well remember, that <hi>John Kilborn</hi> the Elder, did one <hi>Sunday</hi> in our Meeting, fold his Arms, and ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and by and by leaped and jumped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 18 Inches at a time, until he jumped round the Room. I know, that ſome are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live ſtill, that know theſe things are true. But, let it be noted, not a Chapter in the Bible was ever read amongſt us, but all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to adhere to the <hi>Light within,</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the <hi>Light within,</hi> and to follow the Teachings thereof, as a Guide ſufficient to lead us to Salvation; yea, above Scripture, above Fathers, above Councils, and above Churches: <hi>Fran. Howgill</hi>'s Works, p. 602, to 627. This I now confeſs was a Paradox; not Orthodox, but abſolutely Heterodox: For let the Scripture command Subjects to be obedient to Magiſtrates, Children to obey their Parents, Wives to reverence their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and live in Subjection to them, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey their Maſters, Chriſtians to obey their Paſtors, all this ſignified little; the <hi>Light within</hi> (our Teachers taught us,) was Chriſt, and Chriſt the Power of God, the higher Power, to which every Soul was to be ſubject; yea, all Power in Heaven and in Earth was committed to the <hi>Light,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting <hi>John</hi> 5.23,24. <hi>Acts</hi> 17, <hi>to</hi> 31. See
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65629:38"/> 
                  <hi>Joſiah Coal</hi>'s Works, p. 93. And that no Command in Scripture was any further bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than as we were convinced of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs thereof, by the <hi>Light within us. Ed. Burrough</hi>'s Works, p. 47. So, that all our Obedience to God, and his Commands, were bottomed and founded on our Conviction, by the <hi>Light within,</hi> that being the only Rule, Judge and Guide, both ſuperior to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, Fathers and Councils. <hi>Quakeriſm a New Nick-name for Old Chriſtianity,</hi> by <hi>W. Penn,</hi> p. 71. For, ſaid they to us, That <hi>what is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and greater,</hi> Truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Quakers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 7.</p>
               <p>By which, it is ſelf-evident, That theſe Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meetings were deſigned to wean us off from ſo much as the Remembrance of all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Religion, and alſo, to prepare us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the falſe Notions of <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> for, had they indeed exhorted us, to have regard to our <hi>Light within,</hi> and the Dictates of our Conſciences, which prompts to Good, and checks for many Evils; in Obedience to the Commands of Holy Scripture, this would have been ſafe, for I believe we ought ſo to do, and 'tis the ſame the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preſs and exhort us to. Oh! but this would not do our Teachers Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; they muſt bring us off from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Commands, as inferior to their Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Speakings; for the Book laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65629:38"/> is ſaid to be given forth from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, in <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>George Fox</hi> the Younger, See <hi>Title Page.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing queſtioned by a Miniſter, <hi>p.</hi> 7. VVhether the <hi>Quakers</hi> Speaking was of as great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as any Chapter in the Bible? <hi>George Whitehead</hi> reply'd, ſaying, <hi>That which is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in</hi> ANY, <hi>is of as</hi> GREAT AUTHORITY <hi>as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Chapters are, and</hi> GREATER. So that the plain Conſequence of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, is, That the Authority of this little Pamphlet of <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s and <hi>Fox</hi>'s VVriting, is of Greater Authority than the Bible; and not only that, but all their other Pamphlets which they give forth (as they pretend,) from the Spirit of Truth, or Light within. The ſaid Miniſter propoſed another Queſtion to <hi>Whitehead, viz. Is the Moral Law, or Ten Commandments, a Rule to the Chriſtian's Life, or is it not?</hi> p. 18. To this <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> reply'd, ſaying, <hi>Thou might as well ask, If the Moral Law be a Rule to Chriſt, for the Chriſtian's Life and Rule is Chriſt;</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their <hi>Light within:</hi> From whence it's plain, that the Ten Commandments are not the <hi>Quakers</hi> Rule: No, no, not unleſs they be convinced by their <hi>Light within,</hi> of the Reaſonableneſs of their Obedience, as Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> teaches, and <hi>Edward Burroughs,</hi> their great Prophet, <hi>Quakeriſm a New Nick-name, &amp;c.</hi> p. 71. <hi>Burrough</hi>'s <hi>Works,</hi> p. 47. And by theſe, and the like Arguments, our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65629:39"/> brought us off, from believing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to be the VVord of God: And as ſuch, to have Authority over us, and Binding to us, whether convinced, or not convinced; by theſe Means, they brought us from the Practice of repeating the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> in our Families: By theſe cunning Slights, they by degrees brought us off the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſt, as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> asking Forgiveneſs of Sin, and the like Chriſtian Duties, in which many of us had been Educated, and which the Scriptures command and exhort to. And by reaſon of this, and the like Doctrine, together with not reading the Holy Scriptures in our Meetings, but their Epiſtles only, as in my former Books I have at large ſhewed; we came to forget, and not regard, nor have Faith in the Crucified Jeſus, who died for our Sins, and roſe again for our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; and that in theſe Fundamental Points following; namely, 1. That Faith in Chriſt, as he outwardly ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was neceſſary to our Salvation, provided we hearkened diligently to our <hi>Light within.</hi> 2. That Juſtification and Sanctification, is by the Blood of Chriſt outwardly ſhed. 3. That there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Body that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 4. That Chriſt ſhall come without us in his Glorified Body, to Judge the Quick and the Dead, at the laſt Day; even the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that was Born of the Virgin, Died, Roſe, Aſcended, and now Sits at the Right Hand of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65629:39"/> God in Heaven, making Interceſſion for us: <hi>News out of the North,</hi> p. 14. As alſo that there was little need of Preaching the Literal Knowledge of Chriſt's Death, Miracles, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion, becauſe they are generally believed by all ſorts profeſſing Chriſtianity: See <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi>'s Book, <hi>The Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> p. 29. I ſay, by our Teachers thus ſlighting the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, as Death, Duſt, and Serpents Food, of which I have largely treated elſewhere; and by their other Doctrine ſcattered up and down their Books, they brought us off from the Belief and Expectation of theſe Things, as <hi>George Keith</hi> by his Third Narrative, has clearly made to appear; and as a Pregnant Inſtance thereof, with reſpect to my ſelf, ſee my Firſt Book I printed, <hi>De Chriſ. Lib.</hi> Part 2. which, altho' it treat of the beſt part of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and gave a mortal VVound to the Juriſdiction of their Female Government, yet it ſet not forth any one of theſe four Fundamental Points: For, as their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie in pretending to be plain, ſincere, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and innocent, was a means to attract and draw me after them; ſo, the like Hypocriſie in pretending to gather to the Light, leave People to their Light, as a ſufficient Rule, Judge and Guide, <note n="(c)" place="margin">Yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting quite contrary, as anon will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was one Reaſon why I left them. I do not look upon it ſo eminently my Buſineſs, to ſet forth the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Advantage and Uſe of the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65629:40"/> Creed, Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper;</hi> no, every Bookſeller's Shop is furniſhed with plenty of ſuch Books, which are writ by Men of great Learning and Skill; which, ſhould I write after them, it would be next to light a Candle at Noon-day, when the Sun ſhines in its Brightneſs. Tho', if I lived in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where ſuch Arguments were not, I thank God, I could, through the Study of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures (and the Knowledge I have of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal part of Chriſtianity thereby,) ſpeak ſomewhat to the Point, and which might be uſeful too: No, I take it to be my Buſineſs and Office, amongſt others, to unmask and diſcover the Errors and Pernicious Principles of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and therefore refer to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Andrews</hi> upon the Commandments, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> upon the Creed, Dr. <hi>Cumber</hi> upon the Lord's Prayer, and indeed, what elſe the Church teach.</p>
               <p>And to make it yet more evident, if more can be, that the very Deſign of theſe Silent Meetings was to bring us off, and wean us from the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion; and thereby, to mould us, and ſquare us, as fit Tools for their Turn, to ſupplant and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. And this I know, that the more we obeyed the Doctrine of our new Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the more we grew dead to all Inſtituted Religion.</p>
               <p>For, as Univerſities, and other Schools of Learning, as well amongſt the Jews as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65629:40"/> had a tendency to prepare Men, and thro' God's Aſſiſting Grace, were a means, and a help to ſuch as were to be Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſet apart for the VVork of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; ſo I do affirm, and that from an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Knowledge, That theſe Silent Univerſities tends only to empty the Mind of all true and ſolid Notions of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and only to prepare them for the wild Notions of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which hath ſuch a ſandy Foundation, that to this Day they have not been able to produce their Articles of that Faith they pretend to; but are, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſaid <hi>Penitential Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> p. 63. i. e. <hi>The Quakers are amongſt us a diſgraced broken Sect, &amp;c.</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their pretence to Unity, Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to be of one Mind, referring oft to their Beginning; when, alas! ſome will pay Tythes, ſome not; ſome ſhut up their Shops on Faſt-Days, ſome not; ſome for Thee and Thou ſtill, but moſt of them not, but are like other People; ſome wet <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſome not; ſome for this, ſome for that; and ſome for neither this nor that; as in a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Things I could ſhew.</p>
               <p>But, leſt any ſhould think me partial in ſtating the Caſe, and in ſhewing the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of our Silent Meetings, or Schools of Ignorance, I ſhall now proceed farther to prove my Reaſons, and that from plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact; that ſo it may appear, as well from our printed Books, as from our known
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65629:41"/> Practice, what a ſtrange Effect theſe Silent Meetings had upon us; and, how we thereby became not only levened into a Temper, to throw off all Inſtituted Religion, but to a degree higher, even to throw Contempt both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Scriptures, Ordinances and Miniſters, and all things Sacred, crying down all Forms and Conſtitutions, how ancient and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoever they were, and all under a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a higher Diſpenſation, even the <hi>Light within, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For ſaith <hi>W. Penn, We [Quakers] being withdrawn from every Form and Conſtitution, to wait [in Silence] for Life from God, and not from beggarly Elements, and therefore made a Prey to all Parties; againſt whom every Hand have been lifted up, and forſaken by all Civil Power, &amp;c.</hi> The Guide Miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>p.</hi> 32.</p>
               <p>To this, let me add the Teſtimony of one of our greateſt Prophets; his VVords are theſe; <hi>(i. e.) I dare not daub</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>) <hi>with untempered Mortar; for where they</hi> (i. e. <hi>Profeſſors of Chriſtianity) are, I was,</hi> viz. <hi>in Performances, in Ordinances, in Family-Duties, in Hearing, in Reading, in Prayers and Faſtings, in my own Will; and all this is Will-worſhip. But when that one thing</hi> (<hi>the</hi> Light) <hi>came, which was needful, I then began (waiting in Silence) to learn to be a Fool; inſomuch, that I durſt not give God thanks for the Victuals that were ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.</hi> A Muſick Lecture, <hi>p.</hi> 25.</p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65629:41"/>
               <p>Thus it is plain, that our Teachers led us into this Silent way of pretended Worſhip, which never was known before ſince the World began. Indeed, Conſideration and Meditation are good, and ought often to be the Exerciſe of Chriſtians; but then they have an Object to Meditate upon; either the Works of Creation and Providence, which affords much Comfort, and Cauſe to praiſe God our great Creator; or elſe, on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his Death, and Sufferings, and perfect Obedience, and the like. But, I ſay, to go on purpoſe to a Meeting, and there ſit ſtarving in the Cold three or four Hours together, ſpeaking never a Word, nor as near as we can, think a Thought of our own; this is ſuch a new and non ſuch way of Worſhip, as neither Prophets, Chriſt's Apoſtles, nor any Chriſtian Church to this Day, ever gave Countenance to, or Preſident for; I grant, That <hi>John Reeve</hi> and <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> who came forth with <hi>George Fox,</hi> and their Books bear the like Face, <hi>viz. Tho' all viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Worſhip is now become of no value in the Eyes of the Lord, yet it may be truly ſaid, that Chriſt is with his Apoſtles always to the end of the World, in all thoſe that Worſhip him in Spirit and Truth; I mean, thoſe Sober Silent Saints, whoſe Language and Practice ſpeaketh forth the Spirit and Power of the Scriptures in them; theſe Silent Saints I ſpeak of, from an unerring Spirit, — from an infallible Light, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65629:42"/> from the Divine Majeſty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joyful News from Heaven,</hi> p. 61, 72.</p>
               <p>Reader, I have by me <hi>Lodowick Muggle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Journal, or Works, bound up in one Volume, containing eleven diſtinct Books in <hi>Quarto,</hi> and above One Thouſand Pages; and ſo like to <hi>George Fox</hi>'s, that I intend they ſhall ſtand together in the Library of <hi>Chriſt's Church</hi> College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> with the Works of <hi>Burroughs, Bayly, Smith,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that ſo any who are concerned with the Quakers Errors, may be furniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Reader, you ſee, that <hi>Muggleton</hi> and <hi>Fox</hi> ſtand on the ſame Bottom; <hi>Fox</hi> was unerring, ſo was <hi>Muggleton; Fox</hi> was for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Light, ſo was <hi>Muggleton; Fox</hi> was for Silent Saints, ſo was <hi>Muggleton,</hi> only <hi>Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton</hi> keeps cloſe to his Principles; for as he denies all Ordinances, ſo he does not Preach, Pray, nor Baptize, nor Adminiſter the Sacrament: But the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as in the Inſtance of <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> above-quoted, pretend to be againſt all Ordinances, and yet own Preaching and Praying, and deny Baptiſm and the Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, ſince I have no Author, nor never read of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> that juſtifie the <hi>Quakers</hi> Silent Meetings, I will produce one Paſſage more, <hi>i. e. That the Worſhip requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him from his Saints, was an Inward Stilneſs, by which their Souls were made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hearken to the Voice or Motion of bis moſt Holy Spirit, ſpeaking in them. — Thus from an unerring Light, I have remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65629:42"/> to the Elect, what is the very true God, and his Spiritual Worſhip accepted of him; 'tis not Outward Praying, Preaching, Faſting or Thankſgiving, to be ſeen of Men; but it is an Inward, Spiritual, Silent Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Praiſing, Faſting and Feaſting, upon the Glorious Things of Eternity, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen by Divine Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. p. 41, 43. Ibid.</p>
               <p>Thus I have ſhewed, that <hi>Lodowick Mug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleton</hi> was a better Quaker of the two than <hi>Solomon Eccles:</hi> But that it may appear, that as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have teſtified againſt the Chriſtians for owning the Authority of the Bible, ſo let them ſee they have a Partner, namely <hi>Muggleton,</hi> who ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 49. <hi>Ibid. Again, in the next place, I ſhall demonſtrate the Vanity of the Miniſtry of the Baptiſts; I need not tell you the Foundation upon which they build their Worſhip, becauſe it is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Letter</hi> 
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">The <hi>Quakers</hi> Language to a Tee.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Scripture, and their own lying Reaſon, which is the Devil in them: All true Chriſtians are now under the Miniſtry of the Holy Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are no more bound in Conſcience to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Worſhip; I ſay again, that above this</hi> 1000 <hi>Years there hath not been a Man ſent to Preach or Propheſy,</hi> p. 50. <hi>How then canſt thou poſſibly become a Miniſter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, by Authority from another Man's Words or Writings, unleſs without their Letter, thou wert immediately moved to ſpeak by the Holy Spirit, as they were? Moreover, tho' the Scriptures in themſelves
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65629:43"/> are true, yet there is nothing but Death in them to a Carnal Spirit: The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life; and can a dead and killing Letter give the Power, to become a Spiritual Miniſter of Chriſt's Ordinances to his Elect People? I trow not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus doth <hi>Lodowick</hi> profeſs the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of Judgment, the ſame way of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Meetings, the ſame Perfection and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Light to Guide, moved thereby imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately. Again, they join, like <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Foxes, againſt the Scripture, a dead Letter, a killing Letter, a carnal Letter. I think I have ſaid enough at this time, of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony betwixt <hi>Lodowick Muggleton,</hi> and the Quaker Teachers, tho' I could bring many of the like Inſtances.</p>

                  <p>IS it ſo, that whereas it is written, <hi>John</hi> 5.23,27. <hi>For the Father judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judgment to the Son, and hath given him Authority to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of Man:</hi> Confirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath appointed a Day, in which he will judge the World in Righteouſneſs, by that Man whom he hath Ordained, whereof he hath given Aſſurance unto all Men, in that he hath raiſed him from the Dead?</hi> I ſay, Is it ſo?

Oh! what Care ought to be taken, that theſe People ſhould be ſhunned, and theſe falſe Worſhippers be rejected, as a contagious Diſeaſe? Is it ſo, that the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold, that what is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in any, is of greater Authority than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, which was ever ſince the Days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, brought as a Proof, to caſt the Ballance in all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies?

               <argument>
                  <p>Shews that this Anarchy did not laſt long, but a Government was ſet up: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a Single Perſon, as Pope over us; and ſometimes the Light in the Body of Friends, claimed a Power over the Light in the Particular.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOR after we became dead to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the World, as we accounted thoſe Chriſtian Duties, commanded by Chriſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65629:44"/> and his Apoſtles, and practiſed by Chriſtian Churches downwards, as Baptiſm, Supper, Confeſſion of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and became ſtedfaſt and fixed in the Notion of Quakeriſm; of which I gave only a Hint as I paſſed thro' my Pilgrimage in that Particular; then our Teachers began to bethink themſelves of the Neceſſity of a Government in our Church, as well as our Neighbours; and if a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then a Governour; and this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be either Inward, or Outward: The Inward we had tried, and found defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; for the Diſciple pretended he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, as well as the Apoſtle; and he thought he had as much Right to follow his <hi>Guide,</hi> i. e. his <hi>Light within,</hi> as to follow and obey the Light in his Teacher, or the Light in any Man.</p>
               <p>Upon this, the Teachers met in Council at <hi>London,</hi> in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1666, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle this ſo neceſſary, as well as difficult Point; and many Arguments paſſed between the Clergy and Laity, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the Deputies. At laſt it was decided, That the Body ſhould govern, and the Light in the particular ſhould ſubmit to the Light in the Body. But ſtill this Body being without a Head, ſeemed like a Monſter; ſo that there was a Neceſſity to find a Head to clap upon this Body. Well, this Head muſt either be viſible, or inviſible; the latter it could not be, for then the leaſt Hearer would plead his Light, his Guide, his Judge, his Leader, as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65629:45"/> the Teachers told them in the beginning, when they decoyed them over to them. So then it was reſolved, it muſt be <hi>George Fox;</hi> he being the firſt, muſt become our Great Apoſtle; who, together with the Body, was to Govern from Eaſt to Weſt, and from North to South. Since which time, it was in vain for any ſingle Perſon to plead the Sufficiency of his Light, or the Authority of it, for to the Light in the Body was all Power in Heaven and Earth committed. <hi>Joſ. Coal</hi>'s Works, <hi>p.</hi> 93.</p>
               <p>And to ſupport this Glorious Cauſe, <hi>Will. Penn</hi> wrote a Book, wherein he affirmed, <hi>That it is a Dangerous Principle, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to True Religion; and which is worſe, it is the Root of</hi> Ranteriſm, <hi>to aſſert, That nothing is a Duly incumbent upon thee, but what thou art perſwaded, [or convinced] is thy Duty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A Brief Examination and State,</hi> p. 3. This was Printed in 1681, and and written by the ſame <hi>W. Penn,</hi> who in the Year 1673. wrote his Book, ſtiled, <hi>Quake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm a New Nick name for Old Chriſtianity;</hi> where he then Judged it ſo far from <hi>Rante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm,</hi> to act as they were perſwaded, that, <hi>Page</hi> 71. he ſaith, <hi>No Command in the</hi> SCRIPTURE <hi>is any farther</hi> OBLIGING <hi>upon</hi> ANY <hi>Man, than as he finds a</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VICTION <hi>upon his Conſcience; otherwiſe, Men (ſaid Mr.</hi> Penn) <hi>ſhould be engaged without, if not againſt Conviction; a thing unreaſonable in a Man,</hi> &amp;c. Thus then it's plain, That with reſpect to the Commands
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65629:45"/> of God recorded in the Holy Scriptures, Men are to be at Liberty; they are to obey, if they be convinced or perſwaded it's their Duty ſo to do; if not, they may, by Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Doctrine, be at Liberty. And ſo ſaith <hi>E. Burroughs;</hi> for, (ſays he) <hi>That is no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to me, what he commands to another; neither did any of the Saints, that we read of in Scripture, act by the Command which was to another, not having the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Works, <hi>p.</hi> 47. And if we read on in the ſame Page, we may find, that theſe Commands of God, thus rejected by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> unleſs they have them anew, as the inſpired Apoſtles and Prophets had, were Baptiſm, and other Ordinances.</p>
               <p>And now let me return, to ſee what things <hi>Will. Penn</hi> would have done and obey'd, Conviction, or no Conviction; and this will give us ſome Light into their <hi>Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi> thus to reject the Commands of God, recorded in Scriptures, and teach, that none need to obey them, unleſs convinced of the Uſefulneſs of them, as they have done theſe 40 Years. <hi>GO TEACH ALL NATIONS, BAPTIZING,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>DO THIS IN REMEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRANCE OF ME,</hi> &amp;c.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:65629:46"/>
               <p>Well, I ſay, let us hear what the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Quakers</hi> are, That whoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them pleads for their Liberty, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey, or not to obey, are <hi>Ranters, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> and what not. See his <hi>Brief Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Page</hi> 11. <hi>And this I affirm, from the Underſtanding I have received of God, not only that the Enemy is at work to ſcatter the Minds of Friends by that looſe Plea; What haſt thou to do with me? Leave me to my Freedom, and to the Grace of God in my ſelf, and the like. But this Propoſition and Expreſſion, as now underſtood and alledged, is a Deviation from, and a Perverſion of the Antient Principle of Truth. For this is the plain Conſequence of this Plea: If any one ſhall ſay, I ſee no Evil in paying Tythes to Hireling Prieſts, in that they are not claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Divine Right, but by the Civil Laws of the Land. I ſee no Evil</hi> (ſaith another) <hi>in marrying by the Prieſt, for he is but a Witneſs. I ſee no Evil</hi> (ſaith a third) <hi>in declining a Publick Teſtimony in Suffering-Times, for I have</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s and</hi> Paul<hi>'s Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I ſee no Evil</hi> (ſaith a fourth) <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Perſons of Men; for whatever others do, I intend a ſincere Notice, that I take of thoſe I know. I ſee no Evil</hi> (faith a fifth) <hi>in keeping my Shop ſhut, upon the World's Holy-Days, [Faſt-Days,] for I would not willingly give Offence to my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65629:46"/>
               <p>Reader, I have been the larger on this Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe it may evidently appear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all their Gloſſing, that like the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> their Forefathers, they make void the Commands of God, by exalting their own Traditions above them, ſaying, None are any further obliged to obey the Commands of God in the Holy Scripture, than they are convinced or perſwaded by their <hi>Light</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; but their own Commands, ſuch as not paying Tythes, not marrying with a Prieſt, not putting off the Hat, not ſhutting up their Shop-Windows on Holy-Days, and Faſt-Days, this is highly Criminal; to plead their Liberty in theſe Things, is Ranteriſm and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>To confirm this, <hi>George Whitehead</hi> ſaid, in Anſwer to a Miniſter's Queſtion, <hi>i. e. Is the Moral Law, or Ten Commandments, a Rule to the Chriſtian's Life, or is it not?</hi> Truth defending the <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. p. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I anſwer,</hi> (ſays <hi>G. W.) thou might as well ask, If the Moral Law be a Rule to Chriſt? For the Chriſtian's Life and Rule is Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. meaning the <hi>Light within: Queſt. to Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 27. And this is much like <hi>Iſ.

               <p>But for their poor infatuated Diſciples to plead, whether to conform or not, whether to obey or not, the Commands of G. <hi>Fox, i. e.</hi> not paying Tythes, not to be Married with a Prieſt, not to put off the Hat, not to open their Shops on Feaſts or Faſt-Days; I ſay, to plead to be left to their Freedom herein, and the Grace of God in their Hearts; Oh! no: Says <hi>W.

                     <head>1. The Quakers Creed.</head>
                     <p>WE believe that the Light within us is the True and Eternal God, which Created all things, and that by me the Light all things are upheld; and that there is not another beſides me that can ſave; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65629:50"/> we believe we are endued with the Almighty Power of God; and thereby have wrought Miracles; and conclude, we are equal to God; and that our Speaking is of greater Authority than the Bible.</p>
                     <p>VVe believe our Light within is Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, tho' we cannot believe that this our Light within, to whom we direct our Diſciples to expect Salvation, by was ever cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, by Nailing to a Croſs; nor that he Died, or was Buried; nor that he was Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, Spitted upon, Smote with the Palms of the Hands of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for he never was ſeen with Carnal Eyes; nor that he Roſe from the Dead the Third Day; nor that he Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (in the Sight of the <hi>Galileans</hi>) into Heaven, and there Sit at the Right Hand of God; but that all Apoſtate Chriſtians that ſo teach, are falſe Miniſters; nor do we believe that our Light within ſhall come at the laſt Day, to judge both Quick and Dead: For the Light within us is the Judge; and the Book is opened within; the Sentence of Death and Judgment is pronounced within; from the Mouth of our Light within againſt every idle VVord, and all the Deeds of the Body within; and Judgment is executed within, and the fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword within, which proceedeth out of the Mouth of the Lamb, <hi>i. e.</hi> our Light within, which will caſt thee into Hell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, where is weeping and wailing within,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65629:50"/> ſealed down under the Wrath of God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Judgment within.</p>
                     <p>We believe the Light within us is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and that theſe three are one, and not diſtinguiſhable, and that ſuch as talk of three Perſons in the Godhead, like Conjurers, are to be ſhut up (with their three Perſons they dream of, which they would divide out of one) in perpetual Darkneſs, in the Lake and the Pit: That the Scripture which the Apoſtate Chriſtians build their Faith upon for this their Trinity of Perſons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, is a rotten Foundation; yea, Duſt, Death, and Serpents Meat; and therefore their Miniſters that tell their People the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are the Word of God, are Deceivers: For the Father, Son, and Spirit, the World, and their Teachers, call three Perſons; but they ſpeak they know not what, therefore believe them not.</p>
                     <p>We believe our ſelves the only Catholick Church, and Elect People of God, and that none are in the Truth but we our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>We never did in any of our printed Books, or printed Prayers from 1560 to 1690, make any Confeſſion of Sin, nor ask Pardon of God for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, who was Born of the Virgin; and why? We teſtifie that the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perſon that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not the Son of God, only a Vail, a Garment, or a Veſſel, in which the Son did inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, which now inhabit in us Believers, and for which Reaſon the Names <hi>JESUS</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65629:51"/> 
                        <hi>CHRIST</hi> belong to us, as well as to him that ſuffer'd. For ſaith <hi>George Fox,</hi> our great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and High Prieſt of our Profeſſion, the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Law, that if any one ſaid he was the Son of God, he was to die, and ſo the Law in the Will doth perſecute <hi>THE SON OF GOD NOW;</hi> where <hi>HE</hi> is <hi>MADE MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIFEST,</hi> as the <hi>NORTH PART</hi> of this Nation doth witneſs, who hath fulfilled that Law in Perſecuting and Impriſoning <hi>THE SON OF GOD,</hi> where <hi>HE</hi> is <hi>MADE MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIFEST; i e.</hi> within us; thoſe who quaked at the Word of the Lord, was ever hated and ſcorned, and in ſuch <hi>THE SON OF MAN</hi> is manifeſt.</p>

               <p>The next Paſſage ſhall be from their Learned <hi>Barclay: It is no ways inconſiſtent with this ſound and unerring Principle, to affirm, That the Judgment of a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Perſons, in certain Caſes, is</hi> INFAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIBLE; <hi>or for a certain Perſon, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to give a poſitive Judgment, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it as Obligatory upon others, becauſe the Foundations and Ground thereof</hi> IS; NOT <hi>becauſe they are infallible, but becauſe in theſe things, and at that time, they were led by the Infallible Spirit.</hi> The Anarchy of the Ranters, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 67.<note place="margin">For more of this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker-Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſee <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm drawn to the Life,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8, to 16.</note>

               <argument>
                  <p>Giveth many Reaſons, both Negative and Affirmative, That <hi>George Fox</hi> took him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Second <hi>Moſes;</hi> and that the Heads of the <hi>Quakers</hi> attributed to him Divine Honour, as Head of their Church, and Lawgiver to it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO come to a right Underſtanding of this, I ſhall firſt inſert an Objection raiſed by <hi>W. Rogers, The Chriſtian Quaker diſtinguiſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Part I. p. 9. [and by him taken out of a Manuſcript, with Names to it,] next <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Anſwer; and then proceed to other particular Reaſons and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>'Tis true, Friends in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were turned to the Light in their own Conſciences, as their Guide; but when it pleaſed the Lord, to gather ſo great a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into the Knowledge and Belief of the Truth, then the Heavenly Motion came upon</hi> George Fox, <hi>as the Lord's Anointed and Choſen, having the Care of the Churches, as being the great Apoſtle of Chriſt Jeſus; and as one, whom the Lord had ordained to be in that place, amongſt the Children of Light in this our Day, as</hi> Moſes <hi>was amongſt the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in his Day, to ſet forth Methods and Forms of Church-Government, and to eſtabliſh Monthly and Quarterly Meetings of Men,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65629:54"/> and Women diſtinct from the Men; and theſe Meetings ſince are called the Church, whoſe Counſel, Advice and Judgment, is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto by every one, who profeſs himſelf a Member of Chriſt's Church; and that we ought to believe as the Church believes, as</hi> G. VVhitehead <hi>teacheth,</hi> viz. <hi>I affirm, That the true Church is in the true Faith that is in God, and we muſt believe thus as the true Church believes, or elſe it were but both a Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Hypocriſie to profeſs our ſelves Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof.</hi> G. VVhitehead<hi>'s</hi> Book, the Apoſtate Incendiary, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>This Objection <hi>W. Rogers</hi> made from the Strength of divers Arguments he found in the Manuſcript, from the VVords and VVritings of divers Perſons, whoſe Names he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to mention; but for the clearing up this Point, VVhether G. <hi>Fox</hi> looked upon himſelf the Second <hi>Moſes,</hi> the great Prophet and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſee his Anſwer to <hi>W.

                        <hi>VVilliam Rogers,</hi> thou ſay'ſt, There is a Spirit riſen at this Day, that gives many occaſion to be jealous, that I am look'd upon by ſome, as that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd of, that God would raiſe up, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. but who they are thou haſt not mention'd.

Then is not this Prophet to be in Man, to give forth his Law, which comes after <hi>Moſes?</hi> But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, to be raiſed up; for I know, that it is he that is oppoſed, and his Law too, by many Talkers of him; and the Light of his Glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Order of it; and what I am, I am by the Grace and Love of God; and will not deny <note n="(n)" place="margin">Deny, no; there was no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy deſired that: But if he had not owned himſelf to be that Prophet, he ought to have been plain, and denied himſelf to be that Prophet, as <hi>John</hi> did; <hi>I am not the Chriſt, ſaid</hi> John, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.20.</note> the Prophet which came after <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor the Election, before the World began, tho' all turn into the Jealouſies in which they were before they were convinced; for I believe few of them that does oppoſe, knows this Prophet that comes after <hi>Moſes,</hi> tho' they may ſpeak of him in Words; of which Prophet I am not aſhamed.</p>

               <p>Reader, The Text and Context being du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd, I mean <hi>W. Roger</hi>'s Objection, touching the common Jealouſies which was amongſt us at that Day, beſides the Letters in the ſaid Manuſcript, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, that duly conſider'd on the one Hand, and <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Anſwer on the other Hand, which was ſo far from denying himſelf to be that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> propheſied of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. and St. <hi>Stephen</hi> teſtified of, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.37. and St. <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3.23. and St. <hi>John</hi> the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, <hi>John.</hi> 1.45. Theſe, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, gave witneſs to the fulfilling of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65629:55"/> Propheſie of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in ſending the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> I ſay, <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Anſwer was ſo far from denying himſelf to be that Prophet which <hi>Moſes</hi> propheſied of, that it confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in that Day; and ſince much more, that he did not deny, but rather owned the Charge.</p>
               <p>But to ſtrengthen my Argument, I ſhall give ſome ſmall Hints, (and but name them, having been heretofore more large,) firſt, What he ſaid of himſelf; next, What his Followers ſaid of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Written from the Mouth of the Lord, from one who is naked, and ſtands na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked before the Lord, cloathed with Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whoſe <hi>NAME</hi> is <hi>NOT</hi> known in the World, riſen up out of the <hi>North; News coming up,</hi> p. 1. which was Propheſied of<note n="(o)" place="margin">This is News in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Riſing in the <hi>North?</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> My Name is covered from the World, and the World knows not <hi>ME,</hi> nor <hi>MY NAME; Several Petitions Anſwered,</hi> p. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, HE</hi> that <hi>HATH</hi> the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that raiſed Jeſus from the Dead, is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAL</hi> with God; <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand to</hi> Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, p. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All Languages are to me no more than Duſt, who was before Languages were; <hi>The Battledoor,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Introd.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:65629:56"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And the Thundering Voice An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I have Glorified thee, and will Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee again; and I was filled ſo full of Glory, that my Head and Ears were filled full of it, <hi>&amp;c. G. Fox</hi>'s Tryal at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> p. 21.</p>
               <p>Reader, Here was Fulneſs of Glory, if his Head and Ears was ſo filled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, 'tis plain it alludes to <hi>John</hi> 12.18, 16.14. and 17.1. For nothing would pleaſe him, but to be equal, if not above Chriſt, as One Hundred Inſtances might be given.</p>
               <p>Next, I may juſt name ſome few of thoſe High Titles and Divine Attributes, which his Diſciples and Followers (Men of greateſt Note amongſt them,) gave him, which are only due to Chriſt, who was the Prophet <hi>Moſes</hi> Propheſied of, and not the ſubtle <hi>Fox,</hi> the doting <hi>Quakers</hi> ſo much admire and idolize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, George Fox,</hi> the Father of many Nations; whoſe Being and Habitation is in the Power of the Higheſt, in which thou Rules and Governs in Righteouſneſs, and thy Kingdom is Eſtabliſhed in Peace, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereof is without end. <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> p. 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Dear and Precious one, in whom my Life is bound up, and my Strength in thee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65629:56"/> ſtand; by thy Breathings I am nouriſhed, by thee my Strength is renewed; I cannot Reign but in thy Preſence and Power; Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto thee Holy One <note n="(p)" place="margin">Holy <hi>George.</hi>
                  </note> for ever. <hi>John Audland</hi>'s Letter to <hi>George Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, George Fox</hi> (ſaid <hi>John Blaikling</hi>) is bleſſed with Honour above many Brethren, and Thouſands will ſtand by him in a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Record; that his Life Reigns, and is Spotleſs; whoſe Eternal Honour and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Renown ſhall remain; yea, his Preſence; and the Dropping of his tender Words in the Lord's Love, was my Soul's Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>The Chriſtian diſting.</hi> Part 5. p. 77.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, George Fox,</hi> a Prophet indeed; it was ſaid of Chriſt, that he was in the World, and the VVorld was made by him, and the VVorld knew him not. <hi>SO</hi> it may be ſaid of this Prophet <hi>G. Fox. The Quak. Challenge,</hi> p. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> To confirm all this, <hi>William Mead</hi> now living, when he gave <hi>William Harris</hi> one of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Journals, he ſaid to him, Here <hi>W. Harris,</hi> I will give thee one of <hi>Geo. Fox</hi>'s Journals, it is a very good Book, yea, better than the Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1.</label> But ſome may ſay, this is only <hi>W. Mead</hi>'s Judgment; ſurely, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not hold, that either their Books, or <hi>Fox</hi>'s
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65629:57"/> Journal, is better, or of greater Authority, than the Bible; for the Fathers and Councils all ſubmitted to the Teſt of Holy Scripture, as the VVord of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſw.</label> To this I anſwer, That <hi>W. Mead</hi> is a knowing Man, I will not ſay a wiſe Man, unleſs in that one Action of his, whereby he vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly oppoſed <hi>W. Penn,</hi> and endeavoured to exclude him out of their Miniſtry, when he was proclaimed a Traytor to his Country, for being charged to be in the Plot with the Lord <hi>Preſton,</hi> and others, and was therefore forced to hide many Years; [and for which, his Preface to <hi>Fox</hi>'s Journal was not admitted to be bound up with the Journal, but waited upon it like a poor Lacquey with its Blue Livery;] I ſay, this Action of his excepted, I will not ſay he was a wiſe Man; yet, as I ſaid, he is a knowing Man, and ſpake the Heart of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> in ſaving, <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Journal is better than the Bible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As you have heard, 'tis queſtion'd by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> VVhether <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> was the firſt Pen-man of the Scripture; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, VVhether either or neither of them. <hi>The Quakers Refuge fixed, &amp;c. p.</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>But as for what <hi>G. Fox</hi> and Friends write, it is from and by the Motion of God's Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, and avouched ſo to be by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council of the Yearly Meeting<note n="(q)" place="margin">Held at <hi>London May</hi> 1695.</note>: And what any of our Friends ſpeak from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, is of greater Authority than the Bible and Chapters are. <hi>Truth defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65629:57"/> the</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 7. Now who can blame <hi>W. Mead</hi> on the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles? Is not a Certainty better than an Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Scriptures lay many Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations upon us; it teacheth us the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> the <hi>Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles Creed, Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the Journal does not at all teach, nor inforce the Belief of; only to liſten, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, and hearken to the <hi>Light within,</hi> and to obey its Dictates: Therefore, as the Journal is moſt certain, ſo it is moſt eaſie, and therefore the beſt Book, and of moſt Authority, and on the <hi>Quakers</hi> Hypotheſis, confirm all thoſe Particulars above quoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scripture teacheth to obey Magiſtrates as the higher Power, and that we ſhould ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Man for the Lord's ſake, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.21. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1,2,3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13,14,17. See alſo <hi>Tindal</hi>'s VVorks, <hi>Obedience to a Chriſtian Man,</hi> &amp;c. p. 111.</p>
               <p>But the Journal, p. 40, to 400. (and our Friends Books) teach both by Precept and Example, That the <hi>Light</hi> in every Man is the higher Power, to whom all muſt ſubmit and obey; for to it, all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, <hi>Joſ. Coale</hi>'s VVork, <hi>p.</hi> 93. and that this <hi>Light</hi> is one, in the Male, and in the Female; but to a proud, heady, high-minded Man, there is no Honour due, tho' he be in a place to Rule, <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Primer,</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65629:58"/> p. 43. And if ſo, who can ſay, that <hi>W. Mead</hi> ſpake unadviſedly, in ſaying, The Journal of <hi>Fox</hi> is better than the Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles? I think him a right <hi>Quaker,</hi> a knowing Man, and one that loves a Certainty better than an Uncertainty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Scriptures teach, That VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould obey their Husbands; yea, that they Reverence them, and live in Subjection to them as their Head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 30, to the end. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22. quoting <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> as an Example.</p>
               <p>But the Journal teaches, That the <hi>Light</hi> is the higher Power, that it is one in the Male, and in the Female, and 'tis the <hi>Light</hi> in each that is to be obeyed; for to that, all Power in Heaven and Earth is committed, <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, p.</hi> 13. <hi>The Journal,</hi> p. 50, to 450. and that there is to be no reſpect of Perſons; and if the VVife conceive her Husband to be gone from the <hi>Light,</hi> and the Guidance of it, and ſhe be moved to rebel againſt her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, betray his Secrets to his Adverſaries, yea, to give publick Teſtimony againſt him, ſhe does well, and ſhall have Praiſe of the ſame, <hi>The Content. Apoſtate, &amp;c.</hi> p. 5. And for this Reaſon, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not put in, or make the VVoman promiſe by their Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Certificate, to obey their Husbands; which, as it is contrary to the Tenure of the whole Book of God, both the Old and New Teſtament, ſo 'tis agreeable to <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65629:58"/> and their Antient Teſtimony. <hi>See their Marriage Certificate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In a word, the Scriptures teach, That Children ſhould obey their Parents, and honour their Father and Mother; that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſhould obey their Maſters; that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould ſubmit to their Governours, and obey Magiſtrates; that Chriſtians ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Paſtors, who are over them in the Lord, who watch for their Souls, as thoſe that muſt give an Account.</p>
               <p>But the Journal, <hi>p.</hi> 20, to 320. teaches the contrary, both by Precept upon Precept, as alſo by the Practice of their great Apoſtle <hi>G. Fox;</hi> who not only broke the Laws, in diſturbing the Miniſters in their Churches, but taught ſo to do; not only refuſed to pay Tythes, but taught ſo to do; not only ſlighted the Magiſtrates Command, (who oftentimes commanded a ſtrict Faſt to be kept,) but taught his Followers ſo to do: Nay, lately one <hi>Thomas Maſh,</hi> an Antient Quaker, living at <hi>Newberry</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> was moved by his <hi>Light within,</hi> to open his Shop-VVindows on the Lord's-Day, as on Market Days, and ſet out his Goods to Sale; this the Journal juſtifies, <hi>p.</hi> 200, to the end; this <hi>Whitehead</hi> juſtifies, <hi>Truth defending the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> p. 18. <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Great Myſtery, &amp;c.</hi> p. 77. Nay, Theft by <hi>Fox</hi> is likewiſe juſtified, who ſaid, And as for any being moved of the Lord, [meaning their <hi>Light within</hi>] to take away your Hour-Glaſs from you, <hi>BY THE
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65629:59"/> ETERNAL POWER IT IS OWNED, &amp;c.</hi> Nay, their idolized Apoſtle not only diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Magiſtrates and their Laws, but declared in plain and ſignificant VVords, That he neither heeded nor valued a Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load of their VVarrants, <hi>&amp;c. Journal,</hi> p. 278.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2.</label> But ſome Men will ſay, How then ſhall we reconcile the Doctrine of <hi>W. Mead</hi> and <hi>G. Whitehead?</hi> Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> ſaith, That <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Journal is a better Book than the Bible; and <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> ſaith, VVe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Holy Scriptures above all other Books extant in the VVorld. <hi>The Country Convert, &amp;c.</hi> p. 26.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, Very well; for <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> thus ſaith, <hi>viz. I MAY SEE CAUSE OTHERWISE TO WORD THE MATTER, AND YET OUR INTENTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS BE THE SAME, &amp;c.</hi> p. 72. <hi>ibid.</hi> Very well; now to make it appear, that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> means one and the ſame thing that <hi>William Mead</hi> meaned, read his little Book, <hi>i. e. That which is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in ANY, is of as great AU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THORITY as the SCRIPTURES and CHAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS are, and GREATER.</hi> Truth defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> p. 7. And on the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Page thus, <hi>viz. WRITTEN FROM THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH,</hi> in <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and <hi>G. Fox</hi> the Younger. Now, if this little Pamphlet in <hi>Octavo</hi> of 70 Pages, be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Authority than the Scriptures and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65629:59"/> are, how much more <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Journal in <hi>Folio</hi> of near 700 Pages? For that which is beſt is of moſt Authority, generally-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that which is of moſt Authority, is the beſt. Thus then is the Journal of <hi>Fox</hi>'s better, in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Eſteem, than the Bible; and thus does <hi>Whitehead</hi> mean, even as Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> ſpoke.</p>

               <p>Thus it appears, how long the honeſt ſort of <hi>Quakers</hi> have take <hi>G.

               <p>I find a Recital of a Letter, writ by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Eccles</hi> to <hi>Robert Porter,</hi> in a Book of <hi>William Burnet</hi>'s, entituled, <hi>The Capital Principles of the Quakers,</hi> p. 41. printed 1668. <hi>viz.</hi> Robert Porter, <hi>take heed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying the Innocent; for I hear thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to a Friend of mine, that I ſhould ſay, That the Blood of Chriſt is no more than the Blood of another Man; I never ſpoke it, but do very highly eſteem of the Blood of Chriſt to be more Excellent, Living, Holy, and Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than is able to be uttered by the Tongues of Men and Angels; I</hi> MEAN, <hi>the Blood which was offered up in</hi>

                  <hi>the Eternal Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9.41. <hi>But the Blood that was forced out of him by the Soldiers after he was dead, who before that, bowed his Head to the Father, and gave up the Ghoſt; but thou ſay'ſt, that was the Blood of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was ſhed after he was dead, which I</hi> DO DENY. <hi>Yet I did ſay, That was</hi> NO <hi>more</hi> THAN <hi>the</hi> BLOOD <hi>of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> SAINT: <hi>Theſe are my Words which thou art wreſting to thy own Deſtruction. I did [alſo] ſay, That the Baptiſts, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, Presbyterians and Pope, are all of one Ground; and none of you underſtand the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt no more than a brute Beaſt: Therefore repent, for God will ſoon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw

               <p>But <hi>G.

Jacob <hi>found in a Deſart Land,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8. I do well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that when I came firſt amongſt you, this was a great part of your Cant; as if you had been ſome Lords Sons, yea, Men of Breeding, Riches and Honour, and left all for the ſake of Souls; when alas! upon a ſtrict Enquiry, (of which I have not been wanting,) I find you in this, as well as in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every thing elſe, horrible Deceivers; for you left your poor Country for a Richer, and like <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Hoſtlers, are obſerved ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never to return thither again. You came from Penury to Plenty, from Labour and Toil to Eaſe and Pleaſure; you came from your Father's poor Cottage, which I have been told by them that ſaw it, that it is not worth 50 <hi>s.</hi> to Houſes worth 500 <hi>l.</hi> (a good Exchange, believe me;) and you were ſo far from being poſſeſs'd with outward Riches, that you came a poor Boy on Foot, and liv'd upon Alms amongſt us, ſometimes a Month here, Six Weeks there, more or leſs, as you could find Entertainment; the mean time, improving that little Learning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65629:67"/> you had, as well as to inſtruct the Children in the Family. But <hi>George,</hi> thou left thy Honour too, how came that to paſs? What Worldly Honour wert thou endued with? Was it to carry a Letter to a great Perſon ſometimes for a piece of Victuals? Very well, I think that is as much as ever [du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thy Dwelling in thy own Country,] thou didſt arrive to; and for this, in time, thou hadſt the Honour to ſend thy Servant, and ride thy ſelf on Horſeback, with a <hi>London</hi> Linnen-Draper riding before thee; <note place="margin">

But HARK, <hi>George,</hi> I find you ſo deceitful, that I fear thou haſt laid a Foundation, in this thy <hi>Jacob found in a Deſart Land,</hi> (and with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign too,) to have thy Friends after thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, when they collect thy Works, to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thy Call to thy Miniſtry, out of thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Country, for the ſake of Souls; when alas! it was for filthy Lucre-ſake, in leaving thy outward Riches; when alas! it was to get Riches and Honour.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> I do not know many of their Teachers now, having been ſo long from them; but ſuch of them as I do now know, and formerly have known, they were a ſort of mercenary poor Men at their firſt Riſe, (ſome few excepted) but very uncharitable in their Language; the World never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the like ſince <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood; and I know not, nor never did, that the Miniſters of that People were ever given to Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; but what they got, commonly they held faſt, and beſide, ungrateful to their Benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors.

               <p>But as to their Hoſpitality and Charity, I never met with any of it: I remember, about Twenty Years ſince, my Wife had a mind to ſee <hi>London,</hi> and I went with her to viſit <hi>Tho.

               <p>I ſhall give but one Inſtance more of this kind, and then tell you who are their own Poor, and who they think themſelves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to maintain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to their Convocation-Houſe, it is ſcituate, and being in <hi>White-Heart-Court</hi> in <hi>Grace-Church-Street, London,</hi> where there is a very large Room four ſquare, with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large Table, which is covered in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion time with a curious Green Carpet; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which may fit Forty or Fifty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men; their Preſident being their <hi>Light within,</hi> which is to ſpeak thro' ſome or other infallibly, and ſo to be taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and round about there are Seats ſet one above another, like the Houſe of Commons, where may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene about Six Hundred; and their Speaker being below, they can all hear him, and he them, with Eaſe and Delight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When this is done, (the Doors being well ſecured, <hi>i. e.</hi> either lock'd and barr'd, or elſe Two or Three luſty Fellows to keep Guard) then the Clerk opens his Bags, and takes out his Books, opens the black Roll, and calls over all the Quarterly Meetings in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Names of the Deputies; and is as careful to ſee that none be wanting, as <hi>Jehu</hi> was, who ſaid, <hi>Call unto me all the Prophets of</hi> Baal, <hi>let none be wanting,</hi> 2 Kings 10.19.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:65629:74"/>
                  <p>This done, they proceed to examine, firſt, the State of their own Affairs, next, that of the Nation, which any way affects them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to their own Church Affairs; it is to ſee that none Preach contrary to their Antient Teſtimony; if they do, they Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, and Expel them out of their Unity, as in the Caſe of <hi>Geo. Keith;</hi> which, in regard it is made ſo Publick by ſeveral printed Books, particularly his Three Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, I think I am the leſs concerned to be particular on that Head; as <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew how they Summoned him to appear before them Day after Day, I think 10 or 12 Days together, where <hi>G. Keith</hi> as readily appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Luther</hi> did at <hi>Wormes;</hi> 
                     <note n="(n)" place="margin">And there was as much need for him; for <hi>New-Rome</hi> is as fatal, and as dangerous to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, as her Elder Siſter.</note> and when they could not make him truckle, but that he manfully ſtood his Poſt, they then caſt him out as a Troubler of their <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and called him Apoſtate, one ſeparated from the Holy Fellowſhip of the Church of Chriſt, and one not fit to Preach and Pray in their Meetings, in that unreconciled Eſtate, until by a Publick and Hearty Acknowledgment of his Offence, and Condemnation of himſelf therefore, he return to Mother-Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the Words of his Excommunication, bearing Date <hi>May</hi> 17. 1695. may more fully appear. Thus then is their Boldneſs mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, <hi>Firſt,</hi> In preſuming to Summons the King's Subjects to appear before them; and then to Interrogate them, Sentence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; yea, and that too, for holding
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65629:74"/> no other Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, than what every Orthodox Church holds. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That he is an Apoſtate, whilſt no matter of evil Fact, or falſe Doctrine, they could lay to his Charge; I ſay, this is bold in Fact.</p>
                  <p>I will not deny, but that Diſſenters have ſometimes admoniſhed ſcandalous Walkers; and if they have perſiſted therein, to the Scandal of their Church-Society, rejected them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I deny that any, whether Presbyterians, Independants, or Baptiſts, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet took upon them to call a General Council, and then, and there aſſume an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to call before them the King's Subjects, examine, try and judge them Apoſtates, for differing from them in Matter of Faith and Doctrine, eſpecially when <hi>G. Keith</hi> held no other Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, than all ſound Proteſtants hold. This then is a Figure of their Church-Government, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrinal Part thereof.</p>
                  <p>Next, As to their Interfering with the Government, and their calling in queſtion Acts of Parliament, and abſolving their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from their Obedience to them; if this can be made appear, I think 'tis worth noticing, the dangerous Conſequences thereof are ſo Many, and ſo Pernicious. And,</p>
                  <p>THEREFORE obſerve, what <hi>W. Rogers</hi> wrote, in Anſwer to an Objection, Whether it were lawful or no to pay Tythes, if the Supream Powers command it? <hi>&amp;c. The Chriſtian</hi> Quaker <hi>diſtinguiſhed from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,

                  <p>Anſ. <hi>We are ſo far from condemning all thoſe who freely pay them, (and not by Conſtraint) that we look upon it the Duty of all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Chriſtianity, to contribute towards the outward Maintainance of ſuch whom they uſually hear, and account to be the true Miniſters of Chriſt, in caſe they have need; and if the Charity of any ſhould be ſuch, as to beſtow upon them one Fifth Part, inſtead of a Tenth, far be it from us to condemn it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This Book did ſo ſtartle the <hi>Foxonian Quakers,</hi> that <hi>Tho.

                     <hi>However, whether you condemn or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, the faithful Followers of the Lamb ſee and diſcern this Spirit, the Nature of it, and the End it tends to, which is downright</hi> RANTERISM.

                  <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 139. poor <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> makes a ſad Complaint, of ſome that had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Ten, nay, ſome Twenty Years, and yet can pay Tythes without any Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Evil therein: <note n="(p)" place="margin">See what a ſad thing it is to break one of <hi>Fox</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</note>

                  <p>Well, theſe Differences grew high, and very difficult to decide, but in time the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came up to the Terms of <hi>W.

                  <p>Well, after much ſtruggling between the <hi>Foxonian Quakers</hi> that hold it Antichriſtian to pay Tythes, tho' voluntarily paid; yea, a compleat Denial of Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh, quoting 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. yea, downright Ranteriſm on the one Hand; and the <hi>Storian Quakers,</hi> who held it lawful to pay, if the Supream Power gave it them; nay, not only the Tenth Part, but even the Fifth Part, if the Party thinks his Miniſter want it: I ſay, great Strugglings, and Writings, and Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, were on both Parts, about this ſo nice a Point, and ſo neceſſary to be decided: Wherefore at a Yearly Meeting held at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, June</hi> 1693. and by the Authority of the ſame, it was thus, amongſt other things, Enacted:</p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:65629:76"/>
                  <q>And therefore, that all due and godly Care be taken againſt the grand Oppreſſion and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Yoke of Tythes, that our Chriſtian Teſtimony born, <note n="(r)" place="margin">Soft Words, and hard Names mixt.</note> and greatly ſuffered for, be faithfully maintained againſt them in all Reſpects, and againſt Steeple-Houſe-rates: — That Friends at all their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, be reminded to call for the Record of the Sufferings of Friends, to ſee that they be duly gathered, truly entered and kept, and accordingly ſent up (to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) as hath been often adviſed, both of what Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are pretended to be due, and for how long a time, and the time when taken, and by, and for whom, and what Goods are taken, and the Value thereof, as well thoſe not exceeding, as thoſe exceeding the Sums or Quantities demanded, (it being a Suffering for both for Truth-ſake;) they being in theſe Particulars found defective and imperfect in divers Counties, which is an Obſtruction to the general Record of Friend's Suffering: And <hi>THEREFORE,</hi> the Monthly and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meetings are adviſed to take more Care for the future, that all Friends Safferings for Truth-ſake, may be brought up (to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) as <hi>FULL</hi> and <hi>COMPLEAT</hi> in <hi>ALL</hi> Reſpects as <hi>POSSIBLE</hi> may be.</q>
                  <p>Thus, Reader, you ſee, That this Act of Parliament being brought to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Light, the Higher Power, it is condemned as a <hi>GRAND</hi> Oppreſſion, and an <hi>ANTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHRISTIAN

                  <q>Be it Enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That if any Perſon of the Age of Sixteen Years, and upward, being a Subject of this Realm, at any time after the Tenth Day of <hi>May</hi> next, ſhall be preſent at any Aſſembly, Conventicle, or Meeting, under Colour and Pretence of any Exerciſe of Religion, in other manner than according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> at which there ſhall be Five Perſons or more Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, over and beſides thoſe of the ſame Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall ſuffer thoſe and thoſe reſpective Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Now tho' it be well known, that the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Religion is not only other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than according to the Liturgy, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to it, yet all muſt be Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that limit them: As firſt, the Liturgy teach the Practice of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Lord's Prayer, and Apoſtles Creed, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have not the leaſt Shadow of, either in their Meetings, or in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; the Church Liturgy teach the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Prayer, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65629:78"/> with Confeſſion of Sin, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> reject as Idolatrous and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. See the <hi>Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> p. 94, to 100.</p>
                  <p>Well, no ſooner did this Act take place, and ſome did forbear meeting in this Riotous manner, but their Preachers came thro' the Nation, and gave out their Epiſtles or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, commanding, rather than exhorting the People, to meet in great Numbers, in ſpite of Law and Law-makers; I receiv'd many Letters to that Purpoſe, one whereof I may recite, to ſhew, how preſumptuous they were, in Summoning the King's Subjects to meet and tranſgreſs this Law, which allow'd a moderate Tolleration, conſidering how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde their Religion runs to all Inſtituted Religion. For there might Four meet, beſides thoſe of the ſame Family; and 'tis probable, that many Families have 12 or 15 in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Here then might have been Satisfaction, to ſuch as only mean to meet for their more private Edifying, eitheir by Reading or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding ſome Portion of the Holy Scriptures, and which is practiſed by the uſers of the Church Liturgy; but alas! this was too mean, too low and contemptible, for theſe proud Boaſters to ſubmit to. The Letter is as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>Thus have I given two Inſtances, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Demonſtrations, That as their Books teach, ſo their Practice confirm it: That their Light is the Higher Power, to which they require Obedience, contrary to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of God's Saints and Servants in all Ages, where nothing that is ſinful (and ſo againſt the written Word of God) is commanded. Read <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13,14,17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1,2,3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. See <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Works. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Obedience of a Chriſtian Man, <hi>&amp;c, p.</hi> 111. and compare theſe Holy Sayings with their Practice, unleſs where Idolatry or Things ſinful are commanded, and then 'tis better to obey God than Man; but this the <hi>Quakers</hi> could never produce: But as they thus ſlighted and trampled upon the Government, ſo did their great Apoſtle glory in it, ſaying, <hi>He did not heed a Cart load of Warrants.</hi> Journal, p. 278.</p>
                  <p>And now I ſhall briefly run through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their other Methods and Ways at their Yearly Meeting, reſerving their Doctrinal Part, which ſupport and influence them, to a diſtinct Chapter by it ſelf.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65629:81"/> Kindneſs, by obeying their Laws: Theſe are plentifully rewarded; ſo that what they call their Unity, is rather a Confederacy, which ought to be noticed.</p>

                  <p>11<hi>thly, George Fox</hi> had a Saying in their Yearly Meeting worth noting; <hi>Penſilvania</hi> had Experience of it; and when they get Power, <hi>England</hi> may alſo; <hi>viz. I do not like (ſaid</hi> Fox) <hi>the Words</hi> LIBERTY OF CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCIENCE, <hi>for there is no Liberty out of the Power: What! Liberty to the Epiſcopals; no. What! Liberty to the Presbyter; no. What! Liberty to the Independant; no. What! Liberty to the Baptiſt; no. No Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty out of the Truth.</hi> Spirit of the Hat, <hi>p.</hi> 12. And for further Evidence, that they are againſt Liberty of Conſcience, <hi>R. Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn</hi> and <hi>Ed. Burroughs,</hi> Men of Note amongſt them, in an Anſwer to the Baptiſt's Declaration, wherein they did declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt an Univerſal Toleration of all Miſcarriages, whether in things Civil or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious; nor are we for tolerating Popery, nor ſuch as ſpeak contemptuouſly of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor any that deny the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures to be the Word of God; and yet we are not againſt tolerating Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Presbytery, or any ſtinted Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now hear theſe two Eminent Doctors of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Anſwer. <hi>What Confuſion is here! you will not tolerate Popery, nor any that worſhip a falſe God, nor that ſpeak Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly and Reproachfully of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, nor that deny the Holy Scriptures to be the Word of God; and yet you are not againſt tolerating Epiſcopacy, Presbytery, or any other ſtinted Form: Why will you not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65629:82"/> tolerate Popery as well as Epiſcopacy? And why will you tolerate the Book of Common-Prayer amongſt the Epiſcopals, and not the Maſs Book amongſt the Papiſts, ſeeing the Maſs was the Subſtance out of which the Common-Prayer was extracted? Here is nothing but Partiality, to tolerate one thing, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the ſame kind.</hi> &amp;c. R. Hubberthorn<hi>'s</hi> Works, p. 228. Edw.

Thus then does it appear, what Friends the Quakers are to Liberty of Conſcience, and how kind they were to Epiſcopacy in 1659. and they are the ſame ſtill; they tell you they are not chang'd; and you may believe them, ſince they have given ſuch a plain Demonſtration thereof in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> where they have both Fined, Whipp'd, or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd <hi>George Keith</hi> and others, for holding the ſame Faith, and Preaching the ſame Faith that the Epiſcopalians hold and teach.</p>
                  <p>12<hi>thly</hi> and <hi>laſtly,</hi> And what I have heard with my Ears, That <hi>George Fox</hi> hath exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Meeting, that when they return to their reſpective Habitations, that ſuch in each County, as had moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and thereby the moſt Influence on the Members of the Houſe of Commons, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to them, and work upon them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">And when at the Houſe, they ſtill, by all the Intereſt they have, make freſh Suits, they have their Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries wait continually, to ſee what comes out; they are quick at their Anſwers; and a Fund or Common Bank to maintain all; none like them but the Jeſuits.</note> And I do ſay, that the whole twelve Inſtances I have named, are not more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65629:82"/> Political than this one; for ten to one if ſome Quaker be not himſelf, or ſome of his Kindred, ſome way related, either to the Members of Parliament to ſerve for that County or Burrough, or to ſome of his Friends; or ten to one if ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> do not deal with him, or ſome near him, or is Tenant to him, or ſome of his Friends; if then ſome one, or any of theſe, or all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, then there is Application made to him time after time; and moſt Engliſh Gentlemen are apt to be kind, and they not knowing the Craft and Subtilty, beſides the Deſign of this People, are apt to tell them, <hi>Well, if I can do you any Good, conſiſtent with a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Good, I ſhall not be againſt it:</hi> And if they meet one that is reſolute, and from a Knowledge of their Erroneous Principles, and how that they are Enemies, and implacable ones too, to all Inſtituted Religion; then they will fawn upon him, and flatter him, (as they did Coll. <hi>Goldwell,</hi>) and deſire him to ſtand Neuter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thanks be to God, the Parliament and whole Nation begin to ſee them, and grow every Day more ſenſible of the Tendency of their Pernicious Principles.</p>

Now any People that adhere to a Foreign Power to be Supream in <hi>England,</hi> beſides and above that of <hi>KING, LORDS,</hi> and <hi>COMMONS,</hi> (who, under God, are the Higher Powers,) are to be ſuſpected to undermine the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether they mean the <hi>POPE</hi> of <hi>ROME,</hi> or the <hi>QUAKER LIGHT</hi> in their <hi>BODY</hi> Aſſembled in <hi>COUNCIL,</hi> (the latter being the moſt dangerous, becauſe not ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;) and thereupon ought to be prevented from holding ſuch Councils, with Doors lock'd, barr'd, or by a Guard of Men ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that none can go in to obſerve their Tranſactions: Again, is it ſo, that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are againſt Liberty of Conſcience, and that they would as freely tolerate Popery as Epiſcopacy? <note n="†" place="margin">Yea, ſee their Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in <hi>R.

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Reaſon is there
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65629:83"/> then for the Quakers to expect, much leſs to preſume, to take the Liberty, (under an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government) to hold theſe Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without Licenſe, which no other Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters either ask, deſire, or pretend to; nay, what the Biſhops themſelves, of themſelves, without the King's Licenſe, can do?</p>
                  <p>Yet to the Quakers own Confutation, ſee their Book, <hi>The Weſt anſwering to the North,</hi> &amp;c. p. 80. viz. <hi>Any Party of Men, under a Government, to make Laws, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully Authorized ſo to do, for the binding of others, and thereunto to require Obedience, is a ſetting up of themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Law, and treading it under their Feet, and rendering them whom they ſo bind, Slaves and Vaſſals; and ſo is</hi> TREASON, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus then is it apparent, that what is in others Treaſon, they themſelves practice in the Face of the Government.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Join the Uſe and Service of their Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Quarterly Meetings together, for Brevity-ſake; as alſo, becauſe they are much the ſame in all Reſpects, only the Monthly is inferior to the Quarterly; becauſe in one County there may be three or four Monthly Meetings, much like Juſtices Monthly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where the Party offending need not be Concluded, but entering his Recognizance to appear at the Quarter-Seſſions, he may have a more full Hearing; ſo it is with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, he may Appeal from the Monthly to the Quarterly Meeting: This I know very well, not barely becauſe I was Clerk in theſe Meetings many Years, but alſo during my Controverſie with <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> I Summon'd him firſt to the Monthly Meeting; and when I found no Juſtice, I Appeal'd from that to the Quarterly, and indeed from the Quarterly to the Yearly; and ſo twice or thrice round, as I remember: For it was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tryal that ever was amongſt them, in regard it ſtruck at the Miniſtry, <hi>viz. WHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER THEY OUGHT NOT TO TELL THEIR NAMES AND HABITATIONS,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65629:84"/> AND THEREBY SET THE MSELVES IN A LIKE SUFFERING CAPACITY WITH THE HEARERS,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The next Inſtance I ſhall recite, and which I think is to the Purpoſe, is, to ſhew the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> implacable Malice, againſt not only <hi>W.

The Chriſtian Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker diſtinguiſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Part 2. p. 43. But this was ſuch a horrible Tenet, and ſo much
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65629:87"/> of Liberty of Conſcience in it, that as you have heard, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It was an Errour of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2<hi>dly,</hi> It came from an unſound Mind. 3<hi>dly,</hi> That Truth, <hi>[i. e.</hi> the <hi>Quakers Light,]</hi> allows no Payment of Tythes at all, under the New Covenant. 4<hi>thly,</hi> They who do pay Tythes, tho' Voluntarily, do therein uphold a legal Ceremony abrogated by Chriſt. 5<hi>thly,</hi> And thereby deny Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh, quoting 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.3. which ſpeaks not one Syllable of Tythes. 6<hi>thly,</hi> That it is downright Ranteriſm, <hi>&amp;c. Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi>'s <hi>Antidote,</hi> p. 78. 139.</p>
               <p>Well, but <hi>W. Rogers</hi> was ſo modeſt, as not to put this Book into the Bookſeller's Hands to Sell, leſt thereby he might widen the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which both he, and my ſelf, at that time, thought might have been compoſed, <note n="†" place="margin">For I did not then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their Fundamental Errours; but Thanks be to God, that as their fair and ſmooth Pretences proved a Snare to catch me, ſo their groſs Diſſimulations proved a Means to ſee them.</note> that he put it into the Hands of <hi>John Barnard,</hi> a Merchant, (being one of the ſeparate <hi>Quakers)</hi> for him to diſpoſe of, and to diſperſe as he in Wiſdom ſhould ſee meet; and ſome Hundreds of them he did diſperſe. Well, he was Summoned time after time, to the Monthly Meeting in <hi>Devonſhire-Houſe, Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> to Anſwer for his Fault; and, I think, he as often appeared: But being of too Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine a Temper to ſubmit to their Arbitrary Authority, and Uſurped Dominion, he ſtill continued ſelling and diſpoſing of this ſo ſad
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:65629:87"/> and ſo lamentable a Book; of which you have heard the greateſt Crime, namely, for admitting a Voluntary Payment of Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to ſay true ſo it was; for there is nothing upon Earth that the <hi>Quakers</hi> thirſt more after, than the utter Ruin of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Aboliſhing the Maintainance thereof: This is the Vein that runs fluently thro' all their Books and Sermons; nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Prieſts ſhould have it, and that it might be a Means to ſtarve them, they are willing to pay Tythes to Secular Uſe: <hi>For</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> G.

                  <hi>it would appear, whether we ſhould not pay our Parts; and whether the Royal Exchequer would not be conveniently ſupplied without the Tenths from the Prieſts,</hi> &amp;c. Thus they could pay Tythes into the Exchequer, to maintain a War, which they equally Diſclaim: Oh but do what you will with the Tythes, ſo the Prieſts do but ſtarve, and their Miniſtry fall, and their Religion overturned; then <hi>HEY BOYS UP GO WE:</hi> But (bleſſed be God) the Fear of that is paſt.</p>

               <p>Reader, What Perſon living, who is a Stranger to the <hi>Quakers</hi> deep-dyed Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, but that would think this <hi>John Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> had committed ſome more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Immorality; nay, ſome almoſt unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Crime? Here is ſuch Endeavours ſaid to be uſed, ſuch Goſpel-Order exerciſed, ſuch Stiff-neckedneſs on his Part wilfully perſiſted in; but behold, all Centre in a moſt profound Piece of Hypocriſie, as I ſhall ſhew, and that from divers Reaſons: And,</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65629:89"/>
               <p>FIRST, In that <hi>Benjamin Clark</hi> their Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, a great <hi>Quaker</hi> in their Unity<note n="†" place="margin">I ſhould have ſaid Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy.</note>, ſold at the ſame time Play-Books, Popiſh-Books, Gypſie-Books, yea, Baudy-Books, ſuch as I never ſaw before; and yet never Reproved, never Admoniſhed, according to Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; never Sentenced and Condemned, neither he nor his Spirit: By which it may appear, how zealous they are for preſerving their own good Name and Eſteem amongſt their Proſelytes, and their own Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, from being brought into Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; and yet all theſe their Proceedings they father upon the Lord, who hates Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and whoſe Laws condemn ſuch wicked Books, as their own beloved Brother ſold and vended every Day. Thus do they, <hi>Phariſee</hi>-like, make void the Law of God by their Traditions.</p>
               <p>For as ſoon as this Excommunication came to my Hand, I (as a Country Man) went to the ſaid <hi>Ben. Clark</hi>'s, and asked for ſome pretty Play-Books for Children, and he produced me a Parcel of all ſorts, <hi>ut ſupra!</hi> of which I bought Eighteen Pennyworth, and noticed it in my next Book, Intituled, <hi>De Chr. Lib. Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 207, which they never did deny, nor did they ever ſentence him as above.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, In all the Records of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that ever I made, or ever ſaw made, during the 16 or 18 Years I was their Clerk, I never knew of, or ſaw any Record of Condemnation againſt any Quaker, for
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65629:89"/> the Breach of any Scripture Commands; but either for writing againſt their Teachers, <note n="*" place="margin">As my ſelf.</note> or for paying Tythes, or for diſperſing and ſelling ſuch Books, as allowed of the Payment of Tythes, <note n="†" place="margin">As <hi>W.

                  </note> or for not Marrying according to their Orders, or for the Breach of ſome one or more of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. An Inſtance of the laſt followeth.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth the <hi>Quakers</hi> Fund, Exchequer, or Common Bank; and the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and ill Conſequences of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have conſidered, that as Blood is to the Veins, which by a frequent Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation thro' the Body of Man, both refreſh the Heart, and ſupport the Head; and that, as the Sinews to the Joints both unite the Members, and ſtrengthen the Body, ſo doth the <hi>Quakers</hi> Exchequer ſtrengthen and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them in the carrying on their whole Deſign: For as Money is ſaid to be the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of War, ſo it may be called the Nerves of Hereſie; for Money anſwers all things. And to ſhew it to be ſo, with reſpect to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I ſhall briefly ſhew, firſt, Their Way and Manner of raiſing their Bank; next, Their Way of Diſtribution: In both which it cannot be expected that I ſhould be exact in their very Words, having forgot great part of their Cant; nor the Particulars to whom they diſpoſe of their Money; that's a Secret kept under Lock and Key: It ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth then, that I give ſome ſure Marks of both, and which, I hope, I ſhall ſo infallibly do, as never an Infallible <hi>Quaker</hi> ſhall be able to deny.</p>
               <p>FIRST THEN, I remember, when I was <hi>Quaker,</hi> we now and then had an Epiſtle ſent
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65629:92"/> to our Quarterly Meetings in the Country, from the Second-Day Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> for a General Collection for the Service of Truth: This Epiſtle thus ſent, I have copied out, and have read it in our Meeting at <hi>Milden-Hall;</hi> I have both given to it, and took what our Meeting contributed, and have carried it to the Quarterly Meeting, where I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken all the Collections gathered quite thro' the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> if not the County of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Which I do think, I alſo had to return to <hi>London.</hi>
                  </note> to return to <hi>London</hi> for the Publick Uſe: All this I know, and, if need were, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it. I do not ſay, but the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. ſometimes do the like; as alſo examine the Accompts, conſtitute and appoint Feoffees, and the like; and to which, the Second-Day Meeting is accountable: But, during the Intervals of their Yearly Convocation, the Second-Day Meeting hath both Power to receive and to diſpoſe, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p>Now whereas for many Years together, the <hi>Quaker</hi> Teachers banter'd all other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for taking Money for their Subſiſtence; the National, for the Tythes, and other Dues; the Diſſenters, for taking the voluntary Gift of their Hearers; whilſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Teach freely, yea, to Write free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to do the Lord's Buſineſs freely; when alas! this was all a Cheat, as in the Story of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon:</hi> For they had not only their Charges for themſelves and Horſes free, Cloaths, Hats, Linnen and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65629:92"/> Woollen oft-times free, but now and then a good Watch free alſo; beſides, out of the Bank they had their frequent Sallaries and Stipends, 10, <note n="†" place="margin">Witneſs <hi>S. Cater</hi> and <hi>John Song<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi> of whom I have a pretty Story. When <hi>W. Mead</hi> was Purſer, <hi>i. e. Songhurſt</hi> pretending want of Money, <hi>G. Fox</hi> ſent him to <hi>W. M. W. Mead</hi> depoſited 12 <hi>l.</hi> and enter'd it in his Book. This did not pleaſe <hi>Songhurſt;</hi> he goes to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and acquaints him with it. <hi>Fox</hi> told him, that was <hi>W. Mead</hi>'s way. Well, <hi>Songhurst</hi> did not like to ſtand on Record a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of Money, who had ſo many Years pretended to Preach freely; away goes he to <hi>W. M.</hi> with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his Sack's Mouth; <hi>W. Mead</hi> takes it, and enters it on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Page, Receiv'd of <hi>Songhurſt</hi> 12 <hi>l.</hi> This made it worſe; for, now he had not the Money, yet ſtill ſtands Recorded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 20, and 30 <hi>l.</hi> at a time; yea, I have been told, That <hi>T. G.</hi> had once 100 <hi>l.</hi> at a time; and <hi>J. Parke</hi> 20 <hi>l. per An.</hi> Yet, when told of this Hypocriſie, they have anſwer'd, They did not Preach for Money, tho' their Teachers did take Money: And might not all other Miniſters ſay ſo too, That Money was not the end for which they Preached, but the Good of Souls; only what they had, was to maintain them in that Station to which they were call'd and ſet apart?</p>
               <p>But <hi>W. Rogers</hi> wrote a Scourge for <hi>Geo. Whitehead, Anno</hi> 1685. where he hath theſe Words.</p>

               <p>Thus, Reader, I have ſhewed by a Recital of Mrs. <hi>Docwra</hi>'s Letter, what Sence ſhe had of their Common Fund, <hi>i. e.</hi> that it was as bad as Hoarding up Arms and Ammunition; and ſhe is ſo far in the right on't. You ſee alſo, what Teſtimonies hath been given out, both Publick and Private, againſt theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Purſe-mongers, and their raiſing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Banks, as that which is ſo pernicious to the Civil Government, that it is as bad as Arms and Ammunition; for Money aſnwers all things: For, having this private Fund, they can pay their Miniſters, and enable them to range the World over, pretending to Teach freely, to forſake their Father's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Riches and Honours, (as you have heard) and all to come and ſpend themſelves, their Strength and Years, for the Good of Souls; and all this freely, without Money, and without Price: And you ſee, your Teachers, they muſt have their Tythes, their Gleabe-Lands, their Eaſter-Reckonings, and their Midſummer-Dues; by which you may ſee, they are Followers of <hi>Balaam,</hi> the Son of <hi>Bozer,</hi> who loved the Wages of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: Now by our Fruit, and the Fruit of the World's Teachers, you may try us, and prove us. Thus poor Hearts, the very ſame People that give to theſe Collections, <note n="†" place="margin">I mean innocent middle ſort, who are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things.</note> know nothing of their Teachers taking Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; nay, many of them will diſpute ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt you, on their Teachers Behalf, That they take no Money, that they Teach
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65629:95"/> freely, as above told. And thus are theſe ſilly Sheep carried away with the Wiles of their Teachers, and follow them as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> did Rebellious <hi>Abſalom, in the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of their Hearts,</hi> 2 Sam. 15.11.</p>
               <p>But, Reader, this Scourge did ſo torment this well-favour'd Harlot, it did ſo ſting and nettle her, that poor <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s dull Pen was not able to bear up: Then came in <hi>Tho.

O the horrible Deceit of this People! However, let it ſuffice, that <hi>W. Rogers</hi> have whipt them into a better Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who now confeſs the Fact, and plead the Apoſtles. But I deny, that ever the Apoſtles Practice pretended to take neither Silver, Gold nor Apparel; and yet, contrary to his Pretenſion, took all he could lay his Hands on: No; this is the Practice only of the Quakers; no Man queſtioning the lawfulneſs of the Miniſters Maintainance, ſave the Quakers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who yet take with both Hands; their

               <p>But come <hi>Thomas,</hi> the chiefeſt Buſineſs in this Chapter is to prove, That the Quakers have a Common Purſe; that they have a Common Fund or Bank; that your Teachers are ſupply'd thereout; that you Clerks (as Hirelings) are paid their Yearly Salaries and Stipends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This and more you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, which Hundreds of your Teachers have deny'd, and ſometimes gained the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of Magiſtrates, and their own Quiet thereby. <note place="margin">Witneſs <hi>Anne Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra,</hi> who telling the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates they had none, they were quiet after, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

I hope thou may'ſt find in this Book an Anſwer to it, where thou calleſt upon <hi>W.

I remember, that at the <hi>Bull</hi> and <hi>Mouth Meeting, Anno</hi> 1677. <hi>W.

               <head>CHAP. X.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Treateth of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Six-Week Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>London,</hi> and the Pernicious Conſequences thereof.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> THIS Six-Week Meeting of theirs is chiefly to conſult about, and defend their own Members throughout the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> from the Penalties of certain Laws, which they fore-know that they ſhall Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or that hereafter they may Tranſgreſs, thro' their being faithful to the Laws and Commands of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and the Government of the Quaker-Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Meeting of theirs is one of their moſt Ancient Meetings for Government, and is made up of choſen Men amongſt them, expert in the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, well skill'd in the Courts of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and other His Majeſty's Courts of Record, and ſuch as underſtand the way and manner of Soliciting the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to ſupport them in all theſe things, they have the Common Bank to aſſiſt them; which, as I have obſerved, is like Blood to their Veins, and Sinews to their Bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That I may not ſeem to impoſe my ſingle Judgment, that there is ſuch a Meeting; that the <hi>Quakers</hi> thereto belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:65629:101"/> are thus Exerciſed, as well as Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, ſee their Anniverſary Epiſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Meeting being acquainted, that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been uſed for Relief of Friends, in relation to Oaths, purſuant to the laſt Yearly Meeting's Advice in that Caſe; and being ſenſible of the great Care of the [Six Week] Meeting for Sufferings, ſtill leave it to the ſaid Meeting for Sufferings, to continue their Care and Endeavours in that Caſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And alſo it is agreed, That each Quarterly-Meeting take Care to adviſe the Correſpondents for the Counties; and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerned, to write only to your Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents in</hi> London, <hi>about their Sufferings, and not to other Perſons, leſt their Suffering-Caſe be delay'd,</hi> &amp;c. The Epiſtle to the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings of Friends in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> p. 3. Printed 1693.</p>
               <p>From whence it is plain, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they are a Meeting conſtituted to take Care of the Quakers Sufferings: And 2<hi>dly,</hi> That this Meeting hold Correſpondency with all the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Soliciting the Parliament on the Quakers Behalf is their Buſineſs. 4<hi>thly,</hi> And that they have a Fund for the Service of their Truth, is undeniable from Matter of Fact in the laſt Chapter, as well as from the recited Epiſtle, which ſay, <hi>Friends appointed to view Accounts, report, That they find they are truly ſtated, and rightly kept,</hi> &amp;c. Epiſt. Ib. p. 3.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:65629:101"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And therefore to point at the Quakers Practical Part herein, it is thus: If a Country Quaker be Sued at the Exchequer, or other Courts, for the Nonpayment of Tythes, or for any other Act of Obedience to the Quakers Commandments, laid down by their Second <hi>Moſes,</hi> if he can but obtain a Certificate from the Quarterly Meeting to which he belong; he then ſends up the ſaid Certificate, with his Suffering Caſe, to the Correſpondents belonging to that Quarterly Meeting, and his Buſineſs is effectually taken Care of to all Intents and Purpoſes; and this Six-Week Meeting ſo manage the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as either to baffle the Plaintiff, be he Prieſt or Impropriator; [as I ſtill remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber — <hi>Smith,</hi> Brother to <hi>Robert Smith</hi> of <hi>Whitle-ſeacoats,</hi> did Counſellor <hi>Holeman</hi> of <hi>Chaterice</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely, i. e.</hi> the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator] or elſe to preſerve their Friends, (they having a Salve for ever Sore) as that he ſhall be a better Man when he ends his Conteſt than when he began.</p>
               <p>To which let me add a ſecond Inſtance out of <hi>VV. Mathers</hi> his Manuſcript ſent to be printed, <hi>viz. They</hi> (<hi>ſays</hi> W. M.) <hi>have condemned many Quakers, as of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, that do pay Tythes as others do: And</hi> Joſeph Clark, <hi>a Preacher, profeſſed to me, That God moved him to refuſe to deliver his Tythes to the Prieſt; the Prieſt Sued him, he anſwered the Prieſt by Advice of</hi> John Feild, <hi>who had promiſed the ſaid</hi> Joſeph <hi>to ſecure
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65629:102"/> his Goods from the Prieſt; which he</hi> (John Feild) <hi>failing to do,</hi> Joſeph <hi>the Day before the Aſize at</hi> Bedford <hi>got a Perſon to agree with the Prieſt for him; and ſince that hath ſaid to me, that he could now pay his Tythes as well as other Taxes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For by the Management of this Confederacy, by ſuch undue Methods, to prevent the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, as it carries off the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor with flying Colours, ſo it tends to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage every Litigious Quaker to ſtand it out with his Lawful Miniſter, and bid him do his worſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So alſo has it been of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evil Conſequence to the Miniſters, who many of them have great Charges to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſmall Livings; and great part of that wrongfully detain'd, by means of the ſaid Confederacy: I ſay, this has been, and in other Caſes will be, very Pernicious to the Publick Peace, and Poſſeſſion of Liberty and Property, if it be not prevented.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The like may be ſaid touching the Statute of 22 of <hi>C.</hi> II. For if in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that Act of Parliament, [or any other] the Juſtices or Conſtables made a wrong Step, if any Quaker got a Certificate from their Quarterly Meeting, ſignifying his Faithfulneſs to their Church Canon, in that Caſe made and provided, <hi>viz.</hi> That he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have FORSAKEN, DECLINED, or REMOV'D his Meeting, like the Worldly, Fearful, and Politick Profeſſors, he ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have his Cauſe ſo managed, as to ride
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65629:102"/> Triumphant, or with <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Rewarded; who pretending he ſuffer'd 20 <hi>l.</hi> for Preaching at <hi>Phakenham,</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> had 10 <hi>l.</hi> ſent him out of the Common Bank, or <hi>London</hi> Fund, by <hi>John Peacock,</hi> late of St. <hi>Ives,</hi> Woollen-Draper: Tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, when <hi>Cater</hi>'s Buſineſs came to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, he did not ſuffer a Groat: Yet ſuch is the Freeneſs of this <hi>London</hi> Fountain, that <hi>Sam.</hi> did but pretend he ſuffer'd 20 <hi>l.</hi> and he had 10 <hi>l.</hi> ſent him, as an Encouragement to go on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Thoſe <hi>Quakers</hi> which ſolicite the Parliament are Members of this Meetings, who derive their Authority and Licence ſo to do from the Yearly Meeting, as above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd; who when the Clergymen are at home, minding their Cure, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe in their Callings, being by Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd, then are the <hi>Quakers</hi> working like Moles under Ground; and ſoliciting ſometimes againſt Tythes, ſometimes againſt Colledges; yea, againſt the very Bells, as I ſhall ſhew from their Ancient Teſtimony, to which they oft refer, and exhort others to keep up to it in all its Parts; I ſay, that I may ſhew a Branch of their Ancient Teſtimony, I ſhall recite part of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Petition againſt the Clergy, and their Maintainance, ſubſcrib'd by above 7000 Perſons, and deliver'd to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> the 20th of <hi>July,</hi> 1659. intituled, <hi>Several Papers ſent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:65629:104"/> Nature of their Ancient Teſtimony, and pointed with a Finger ☞ to two Sayings, which, with the reſt, are full of Impudence: And when againſt the Clergy, I think I may take their Word; their whole Carriage and Deportment, both by Word and Writing, do confirm it: But when for themſelves they have any Favour to obtain, DISTRUST THEM IN ALL THEY SAY, for they II ſtick at no Promiſe; as in the Caſe of their Indulgence; witneſs their Acknowledging the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be given forth by Divine Inſpiration. That it is the Rules of Faith and Practice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt they believe not one Word of what they themſelves ſay; and as a Demonſtration thereof, I ſhall recite one of their Epiſtles, ſent to the Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, ſhewing their Care of their own Books: Nay, them very Books which teach, that the Scriptures are Death, Duſt, Beaſtly Ware, Serpents Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore,</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> From what hath been ſaid, you may obſerve, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is ſuch a Meeting as I have ſet forth; both from their Yearly, and the recited Six-Week Meeting, in caſe the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That their Buſineſs principally is to take Care of the Sufferings of their own Friends, and that how plentifully they reward ſuch as are faithful to their Church-Canons; as in the Inſtance of <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> who for pretending to ſuffer 20 <hi>l.</hi> tho' he ſuffered not a Groat, yet had 10 <hi>l.</hi> ſent him, as a Reward for meeting boldly, contrary to the Law in that Caſe made and provided. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they have a Fund, or Common Bank, and that the Accompts are examined by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee choſen out of the Yearly Meeting for that Purpoſe. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That ſuch as ſuffer for Non-payment of Tythes, are to ſend to the Quarterly Meetings Correſpondents, left their Sufferings be delayed. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You may alſo perceive, what a Confederacy is held by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and how they are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by their Exchequer, to hold Suit with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65629:106"/> both Prieſt and Impropriator<note n="†" place="margin">As in the Inſtance of Mr. <hi>Hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who was a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace, a Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor at Law, yet tired.</note>. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You alſo may ſee, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſolicite the Parliament for Favours; as alſo, how they Petition againſt the Clergy, the Churches, the Colledges, and Bells too: Yea, this is according to their Ancient Teſtimony, and they are not chang'd, they tell you ſo, as I have herein before obſerved. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And as a Pregnant Inſtance of the dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this their Six-Week Meeting, and their common Stock or Fund, obſerve that of <hi>Joſeph Clark,</hi> one of their Preachers before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed; who, tho' he pretended he was moved of God, (their uſual Pretence for their Villanies) yet when <hi>J. Field</hi> and their Fund failed him, he preſently pays his Tythes, profeſſing alſo, that he then could pay them as well as other Taxes; which is a clear Demonſtration, that ſuch as ſtand it out, and will rather ſpend 20 <hi>l.</hi> then pay 13 <hi>s.</hi> is, becauſe they are ſupported by this Illegal Fund, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> You may by this recited Epiſtle, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Confederacy of their Yearly-Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Six-Week Meeting, to ſpread their venemous Books, to infect both Youth and Aged, Male and Female, Old and Young, and all under the fine Notion of the Service of Truth, [meaning Quakeriſm:] For, if they meant the Truth of the Chriſtian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, they would at one time or other read a Chapter in their Meetings; at one time or other recommend to their Monthly and Quarterly Meetings, the reading of ſome
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65629:106"/> Portion of the Holy Scriptures: But not a Word of this in their Epiſtles, not a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter read in their Meetings for Forty Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but their own Epiſtles, their own Propheſies, their own printed Exhortations: Theſe they not only read in their private Meetings in their Families, but they muſt Record (you ſee) this recited Epiſtle in their Quarterly-Book, and ſometimes read it: Oh! 'tis a precious Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>And now, Chriſtian Reader, I cannot but think my ſelf unable to give a full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Caution, againſt the ſpreading of the Gangrene of <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> and therefore give me leave in the Words of Mr. <hi>Ralph Farmer,</hi> a Miniſter formerly of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> to rehearſe part of his Exhortation in his Book, <hi>i. e. The Myſt. of Ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

The Meeting formerly was kept in <hi>Ellis Hook</hi>'s Chamber in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard-ſtreet,</hi> now I preſume in <hi>Grace-Church-Street.</hi> This Meeting doth much reſemble His Majeſty's Privy-Council: For the King, by and with the Advice of His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, can do many things; he can by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation put the Laws in Execution; I think, he can proclaim War, and make Peace: So can this Meeting; they can quicken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of Money, granted by the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they can iſſue out their Proclamation for a War againſt the Miniſters of any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; they can alter and change any Meſſage, ſtop any Propheſie, ſtifle any Revelation, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Voice uttered by the Spirit of the

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:65629:109"/> but to Reprint this Book, to which they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have returned an Anſwer, nor can they.

This is the Word of the Lord to thee, O Briſtol!</hi> Of this moſt horrible Deceit I could give a Hundred Inſtances, and find Matter enough for to write a Book by it ſelf, but I muſt conſult Brevity, leſt my Pen outrun my Penny; and therefore ſhall ſingle out one Inſtance, which I hope will give ſome Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; it ſhall be out of a Book, wrote by <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> entituled, <hi>A Trumpet of the Lord ſounded out of</hi> Sion, <hi>ſounding forth the Controverſie of the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>But before I go to the chief Matter intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſhall recite the pretended Commiſſion of this bold Prophet, and then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, whether the Second-Day Meeting did well, in altering his Propheſie, by adding to, and taking from the ſame; for either they did believe him to be a Prophet, that the Word of the did come to him as expreſly as to <hi>Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel,</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, or they did not; if they did, how then dare they add, and diminiſh, and leave out, in the Reprint of his Works, what had gone for the Word of the Lord, from 1656 to 1672? If they did not believe him to be a Prophet divinely inſpir'd, but an Impoſtor, why did they ſuffer the ſaid Book to go as <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> from 1656 to 1672?

               <p>From whence it is evident, That tho' this Propheſie was ſaid to be as true as any Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Bible; yea, that the Word of the

                  <note place="margin">It muſt be Real or Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.</note> if <hi>Real,</hi> as ſo they always pretended, then is it not great Wickedneſs that it ſhould be thus ſmothered up, and ſtifled, and left out of his Works, ſince tho' the Delinquents and Cavaliers were very wicked, yet upon Repentance there ſeems to be ſome Hopes, which now this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie cannot be inſtrumental in, ſince the Second-Day Meeting hath buried it in Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, in that they did not Reprint it with the reſt of the ſame Book, in his Works in <hi>Folio,</hi> Printed 1672? If <hi>Counterfeit,</hi> What wicked Wretches were theſe Members of the Second-Day Meeting in 1656. to Print it in <hi>Quarto</hi> as the Word of the Lord, and Sealed by the Spirit of the Eternal God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and as ſuch, ſent it up and down to us, to deceive us, by recommending a <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit</hi> Commiſſion for a <hi>Real?</hi> Thus let them take it which way they will, and it is wicked in the Superlative Degree.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; it ſhew'd their Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and Temporizing; for this was wrote in <hi>O. Cromwell</hi>'s time, deſigned, I perceive,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65629:113"/> to curry Favour with him, and to ſhew that himſelf, and his Brethren the <hi>Quakers,</hi> were Enemies to Monarchy: But when it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, it was done in K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond's time, and then they wheel'd about, and complain'd of <hi>O. Cromwell,</hi> and flatter'd the King, Cavaliers, and Court-Party; and then this Propheſie, Sealed never ſo ſtrong, Revealed never ſo clear, the very Day, Month and Year ſpecified, nay, the very Hour in the Morning, yet (as I have ſaid) it not ſuiting with the Deſign on foot, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To root out Chriſtianity, and introduce Quakeriſm, it muſt be ſuſpended, ſtifled and buried. Thus then it appears, how wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceitful are theſe Second-Day Meeters, who can thus prevaricate and diſſemble with God and Man; of which, I could give many Inſtances, but rather refer to <hi>The Snake in the Graſs, &amp;c.</hi> which doth moſt amply ſet forth their turning with the Times, and their facing about with every Wind that might ſeem to blow a proſperous Gale for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Quakeriſm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to conclude, or rather confirm this Head, and to ſhew what Temporizers theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> have been, as well as knowingly Wicked, theſe Second-Day Meeters ever (from firſt to laſt) were, let me add one Citation more, as it lies diſperſed in a Book of <hi>Ed.

But at this time, thro' the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Devices, Craft and Subtilty of the Quakers, that Pariſh, and two or three more thereabouts, are in great Danger of falling from the Church to Quakeriſm; ſeveral of their New Converts go about to Houſes, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning Men and Women to go to hear their Speakers: They are ſo troubleſome in this Nature, as that I am perſwaded ſome have turned, and others muſt turn for a quiet Life. I have obſerved them to be much more hot and eager in making Proſelytes ſince the Peace, than ever they were in the time of the War. They challenge us to meet them, and Diſpute with them; but if we ſhould accept their Challenge without our Biſhop's Leave, I do not know how he would reſent it; beſides, I am not haſty, leſt the beſt Cauſe in the World ſhould ſuffer thro' my Weakneſs: — And the Advantage they would bring to their Cauſe hereby, is, to have it univerſally believ'd, that their Religion is ſo good, and ſo much favour'd by the Government, as that it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can, nor dare be oppos'd by us. — I believe the Intent of the King and Parliament, in granting them an Indulgence, was not that they ſhould diſturb the Profeſſors of the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Religion by Law; but rather, that theſe Legal Profeſſors ſhould not be capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing or moleſting them: I pray God open the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:65629:121"/> Eyes of our Governours, and cauſe them to take into Conſideration this too much, and too deplorable, unlimited and unbounded Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (eſpecially as the Quakers both claim and uſe it;) which, notwithſtanding all the Care, and indefatigable Labour and Pains of the Watchmen of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>will certainly (if not timely prevented,) be the Overthrow of our Church, and Chriſtianity it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Theſe, and many more, were publiſhed thro' the Nations, (and from your Yearly Meetings too;) but no Salutation, no Meſſage, no Prayer for, nor Addreſs to King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as if you were ſtruck mute at the Loſs of your brave Popiſh King.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I do not charge this as an Evil in it ſelf, whilſt our King; but to ſhew the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Zeal to that, and Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his preſent Majeſty, whom God preſerve.</note> 
                     <hi>What can you ſay for your ſelves? Are you like thoſe,</hi> 1 Sam. 10.27. <hi>viz.</hi> The Children of <hi>Beliel,</hi> who ſaid, How ſhall this Man ſave us? And they deſpis'd him, and brought him no Preſents, (<hi>no Prayers, no Addreſſes;</hi>) but the King held his Peace? <hi>O ye unworthy and ungrateful Perſons! Hath not King</hi> William <hi>granted you the Liberty of your Conſciences? What! Have you nothing to ſay for King</hi> William? <hi>Nay, you are ſo far from that, that you have acted quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for when King</hi> William <hi>appointed a Faſt for the Proſperity of his Arms, then you not only Preached againſt the Faſt, but alſo to weaken the Hearts and Hands of his Friends, you vehemently cry'd down all Wars and Fighting</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Mark this, with the Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Time and Occaſion.</note>, <hi>and the like. Is you Zeal for the Proteſtant Cauſe quite gone, or is it gone to</hi> Rome? &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>This Letter, I grant, put them into a Fume and Fret; but they ſoon found a <hi>Salvo, viz. Where</hi> (<hi>ſaid</hi> G.

Apoſtate,</hi> &amp;c. p. 17. as before obſerved.</p>
                  <p>But I ſoon Printed a Reply to <hi>G.

                  <p>But, ſince King <hi>William</hi> came to the Crown, <hi>No</hi> Salutation, <hi>No</hi> Meſſage, <hi>No</hi> Prayers for, <hi>No</hi> Addreſs to him from their Yearly Meeting<note n="†" place="margin">Unleſs this in 1698. now the War is ended, and no Hopes left them.</note>, <hi>No</hi> in all Humility, <hi>No</hi> in all Fidelity, <hi>No</hi> with all Affection, <hi>No</hi> Publick Prayers for his long Life, for his proſperous Reign, <hi>No</hi> Laud and Praiſe that his Enemies are defeated.

                  <p>Query. <hi>What made the Quakers no more concern'd for the Loſs of thoſe brave Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots of our Country,</hi> Eſſex, Ruſſel, (Sidney, Corniſh, Bateman? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)<note place="margin">I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get an Anſwer to this Query.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was ſuch an untoward, knotty Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that all the Quakers were not able to anſwer it, that ever I underſtood: No, no, inſtead of being ſorry, <hi>G. Whitehead, Fran. Camfeild, Gilbert Layty,</hi> and <hi>Alex. Parker,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But to return to the Obſervation I have made on the <hi>Quakers</hi> Publick Prayers for, and their Yearly Meetings Addreſs to the late King <hi>James</hi> II. and their contrary Practice to King <hi>William</hi> III<note n="*" place="margin">No; for what they do at their Yearly Meeting is is done by the Body.</note>. I have ſomething more to offer, as an Aggravation of their Ingratitude, for they made an <hi>Order</hi> for the calling in the Widow <hi>Whitrow</hi>'s Books, (ſhe being formerly of their Society, and by her plain Dreſs ſome take her to be ſo ſtill;) which was in Favour of this Government.

                  </p>
                  <p>December 1689. <hi>The Widow</hi> Whitrow <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> Andrew Sowle <hi>to Print a Book for her, intituled,</hi> The Widow <hi>Whitrow</hi>'s Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Addreſs to King <hi>William</hi> III. <hi>And in</hi> December 1690. <hi>ordered him to Print ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, intituled,</hi> For Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the Humble Salutation and Faithful Greeting of the Widow <hi>Whitrow</hi>

                  <p>Well, this Order was made, where <hi>G.

Let now the <hi>Quakers</hi> remember their Book, where they ſay, <hi>Some of the Presbyterian Nonconforming-Preachers are fled Beyond-Sea, others lurk in Corners here and there, and keep private Conventicles, where many times they preach Sedition againſt their Lawful Prince,</hi> &amp;c. as I before obſerved; and let Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> remember, and be humbled, and thankful for the Favours he has receiv'd, and the Forgiveneſs he has met with: And let him look upon his Preface, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>But as an Aggravation of this their Crime, they did not only make that <hi>Order</hi> for the ſuppreſſing the ſaid Addreſs to the King, which was writ (I believe) in Love and Good-will to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but ſuffered their Printer, <hi>Andrew Sowle,</hi> a Quaker, to print ſeveral Odious and Scandalous Books and Papers of Mr. <hi>Stafford</hi>'s againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and tho' they were friendly and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately acquainted with it, with Deſire that thoſe Scandalous Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might not be diſperſed, yet they could not be prevailed withal to have them ſtopt. However, to do the Quakers all juſt Right, we muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome of them (and indeed but ſome, and that of their Hearers too) were for the Government; who, to give them their due, drew up a Paper againſt <hi>W.

Mead,</hi> and a few more, who would
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:65629:128"/> have had it made Publick; but the contrary Party being powerful, prevented it: Only when <hi>W. Penn</hi> (after his Sculking ſome Years) appeared, (by our merciful King's Favour) and preached as formerly in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings; then <hi>W. Mead</hi> and ſome others took him to task, telling him, That tho' the King had paſs'd by his Offence, yet they knowing him Guilty, (as by the ſaid Letters under his own Hand was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,) they ought to have Satisfaction, as they were a Religious Society, before he preach'd in their Aſſemblies: But he having the Teachers on his ſide, and the Generality of the Hearers, he went on <hi>nolens volens;</hi> and if there had not been a Peace, 'tis to be ſtill feared, that <hi>W.

                  <p>Thus, Reader, I have given you a Copy <hi>verbatim</hi> of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Paper, preſented to the Houſe of Peers; and I being then in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> wrote a Reply thereunto, <hi>March</hi> 27. 1696.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:65629:131"/> and preſented it to the Lord's Houſe, who immediately rejected the <hi>Quakers</hi> Paper, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all its fine and innocent Words, telling the <hi>Quakers</hi> they muſt be plain, and tell them <hi>what King</hi> they mean: <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether they believed he was both <hi>Rightful</hi> and <hi>Lawful</hi> King: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they muſt <hi>Sign</hi> their Paper.

                  <p>Thus, Reader, to prevent their Cavil, that I take but a Piece of their Sentences, and wrong the Senſe, I have recited their whole Teſtimony <hi>Verbatim:</hi> But before I proceed to give you their <hi>April</hi> Ancient Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, let me give the Reaſon, at leaſt one probable Reaſon, why it was rejected, and would not paſs the Houſe of Lords, ſo as to effect their Deſign; as alſo, what Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication I gueſs they had about it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For I being at <hi>London</hi> the 24th. of the ſame Month, I went to the Houſe of Lords, where I had one of the recited Teſtimonies given me, I went to my Lodging, and perceiving their Prevailing, thro' their Pretences of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sincerity and Innocency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I wrote a Paper by way of Reply, and the 27th of

                     <hi>March</hi> I gave away about an Hundred to the Lords, who accepted of them; and preſently one of the Peers came out, and call'd <hi>Geo.

Well, away they went very ſorrowful, and I conceive might have amongſt themſelves a Diſcourſe of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz. G. Whitehead,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">Friends, our Paper is rejected, for yonder was our old Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> and he has deliver'd to the Peers a Paper, ſuggeſting, that we Prevaricate; he has alſo delivered about an Hundred of his Books to the Lords, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>The Quakers ſet in their True Light, &amp;c.</hi> and therefore we muſt get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ancient Teſtimony, more full to the Matter, leſt we loſe the Advantage of our Bill; but let us ſtay awhile, for if we go preſently, who knows but that Apoſtate may reply to our next Paper; for he is ſo Eagle-ey'd, that if he eſpy any thing that's defective, he may be inſtrumental in throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Bill: You cannot but remember, that we were fair for the ſame Bill to paſs in <hi>Anno</hi> 1693. but he then Printed a Sheet, and deliver'd it to the Houſe of Commons,

                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65629:133"/> Ancient Teſtimonies of the Quakers; there is one thing very remarkable, and worth your noticing in the whole Conduct of Quakeriſm; and that in two Reſpects; the firſt is paſt, the ſecond's ſtill to come, and ought to be guarded againſt; and which makes me ſo long on this Head, and ſo plain with them in this Matter; and briefly thus:</p>
                  <p>That altho' no one People in <hi>England</hi> did ſo flatter <hi>Oliver Cromwell, Richard</hi> his Son, the Rump, and all the ſeveral Changes of Government during the Uſurpation, as the Quakers did, nor more oppoſe the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. Nay, not only ſo, but juſtifying <hi>Oliver</hi> in his Murthering K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. and in carrying on the War with all Vigour againſt the Cavaliers and Delinquents. But when the Times turned, Oh! how they laid all the Blame of both the War and Uſurpation upon the Presbyterians, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Baptiſts; as if they themſelves had all along been as Innocent as New-born Babes. This puts me in mind of a pleaſant piece of News we had run thro' our whole Camp when I was a Quaker, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1674. <hi>W. Penn</hi> put forth a Book, ſtil'd, <hi>A Juſt Rebuke to Twenty-one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65629:139"/> And I do ſolemnly ſay, I know of no one thing which this World affords would pleaſe me better, than to ſee this People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn what is Erroneous amongſt them, and perſevere in the Truth, and the Knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, true God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Man: But whilſt they'll excuſe, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, commend, and recommend ſuch vile Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as no Proteſtant Society can endure, I ſhall proceed; and if I be blamed, better Men than I am, (as <hi>Luther</hi> for one) was; who, when <hi>John Eccius, Jacob Hochſtrat,</hi> wrote to him, he quickly reply'd, ſaying, <q rend="inline">By how much the more they rage, ſo much the more I go on; I leave former things, that they may bark at them, and go on to further things, that they may have ſome things more to bawl at.</q> 
                  <hi>The Hiſt. of the Reform.</hi> &amp;c. p. 34. Alſo conſider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Elijah,</hi> a Man both Sober, Serious, and Religious; yet when he beheld the Idolatry of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> which did not much exceed the Quakers, if at all, he could not but mock at them, and have them in a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deriſion, in order to the more compleat Diſcovery of them to the View of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators: For it is written, <hi>And it came to paſs at Noon, that</hi> Elijah <hi>mocked them, and ſaid, Cry aloud, for he is a God; either he is Talking, or he is Purſuing, or he is in a Journey, or peradventure he Sleepeth, and muſt be awaked,</hi> &amp;c. 1 King. 18.27.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:65629:140"/>
               <p>Beſides all this, here is more to be ſaid; for as the Quakers were raiſed contrary to all Men, as they confeſs themſelves, ſo have they dealt by others, as never any beſides themſelves ever did: And therefore give me leave to fill the ſame Cup to them again, which they ſo plentifully have filled to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yea, good Meaſure, preſſed down, and ſhaken together, and running over:<note place="margin">Luke 6.38.</note> For <hi>G.

But in thoſe early Days the Government of the Fund, or Common Bank, was wholly at the Diſpoſe of <hi>Fox,</hi> who, like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> having a Deſire to be eſteem'd ſome Great Man in Learning, he hired ſome <hi>Jews</hi> to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as I have been credibly informed by thoſe which heard the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay the ſame; yea, and ſince have printed it in theſe Words; <hi>Envy and Folly detected, by way of Reply to</hi> Robert Bridgman, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 8. <q rend="inline">We, for our own parts, went to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſpake with the <hi>Jew</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Eighty Pounds in Mill'd Money<note n="†" place="margin">O th is <hi>Dagon</hi> of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers! as <hi>Anne Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wra</hi> calls it: What will not Money do?</note>, paid by <hi>Gerrard Roberts,</hi> beſides the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Bottles of Wine, given by <hi>M.</hi> F.

Thus did the Pride, Arrogance, and Preſumption of this People appear; which, as they confeſs, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were raiſed contrary to all Men: As their Practice in a Hundred Things was contrary to all Men, ſo am I made willing to deal with them, as I would by no other Men: And ſince they have ordered a Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the Churches giving forth an Epiſtle for them to read, why may not I form a few Words out of their own Books, and ſo far as I can, make <hi>G.

And ſince the Quakers would make the Churches read their Nonſence, why may not I draw ſome natural Inferences from the Quakers Doctrine, ſince my End is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to diſplay their Errours, and make them appear in their Native Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion, which by their Teachers are more masked and obſcured? If any ſay, That by drawing a Scheme of their Meeting, and forming a Sermon for them to preach, is to do ſuch a thing as no Man ever did: Let them remember again, That no Man ever yet had the Impudence to write a BATTLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOOR for the Learned Gentry and Clergy of a Proteſtant and Learned Nation, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is; nor to form a Liturgy to be read in Churches, and eſpecially, by a poor Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyman Shoemaker, and an almoſt illiterate

                           <hi>Firſt</hi> then, As to the Chriſtian's Miſtake about the Scriptures, look into the Epiſtle General of our Great Apoſtle <hi>Geo.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65629:147"/> have taken <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> for the Goſpel; that is, Glad-Tidings: No, no, 'tis Beaſtly VVare, yea, Duſt and Serpents Meat; and this I can prove by Two Books, wrote by our Apoſtle <hi>Geo.

And I ſtill affirm the ſame, and do tell you, that it is according to our Ancient Teſtimony; and you know, we cannot change, nor alter, being as unchangeable as our <hi>Light within.</hi>

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:65629:158"/> we have laid them aſide; but leſt all of you ſhould not remember the Words the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians quote, not being much uſed to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they are theſe.</p>

                              <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you: And lo I am with you always, even to the end of the World,</hi> Matth. 28.19,20.

Again, <hi>Matthew</hi> hath it: <hi>And as they were eating, Jeſus took Bread, and bleſſed it, and brake it; and gave to the Diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat, this is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And he took the Cup, and gave Thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink ye all of it, for this is my Blood of the New-Teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Matth. 26.26,27,28.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65629:159"/> the ſame manner alſo, he took the Cup; when he had ſupped, ſaying, This Cup is the New-Teſtament in my Blood: THIS DO YE, as oft as ye drink it, IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.23,24,25.</p>
                           <p>Beloved, I cannot but allow, that if the Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scriptures, were of greater Authority than our Sayings, or that the Words of <hi>Matthew, Luke</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> were of greater Authority than our Sayings, I ſhould be of the Chriſtians ſide; for nothing in the World is plainer ſaid, nor more poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively commanded: But, Friends, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning we were convinced by G. <hi>Fox,</hi> that <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were Death, Duſt, and Serpents Meat; that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were Beaſtly Ware; that all that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of them were Conjurers; that the Letter of the Scripture is Carnal, Death, and Killeth; that ſuch as once told the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a Sacrament were Witches. <hi>News com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> &amp;c. p. 14, 35.

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:65629:159"/> of Force as Water Baptiſm, and the Paſchal-Lamb as Bread and Wine, for ſays my dear Brother <hi>W. Penn,</hi> the Continuance (of thoſe Two Ordinances as the Lord's Supper and Baptiſm) would have been a Judaizing of the Evangelical Worſhip; and to aſſert their Continuance, would be as much as in us lies, to pluck up the Goſpel by the Roots: Hence (ſays our dear Brother) that Appellation <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt,</hi> I do renounce as Unſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural and Unevangelical, and can teſtifie from the ſame Spirit, by which <hi>Paul</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Circumciſion, that they (to wit, Water-Baptiſm and the Supper) are to be rejected as not now required, <hi>&amp;c.

               <p>Reader, <hi>W. Penn</hi> tells his Reader, in his <hi>Ser. Apol. &amp;c.</hi> p. 79. That his deſigned Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod in his Anſwer, is not the common Road of Printing his Adverſaries Words at large, on all Occaſions; ſo I tell thee, yet in many Caſes I recite the whole: However, by this time, you have not only an Account of the high Value the Quakers ſet upon themſelves, as in the former Chapter, but of their deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Proteſtant Miniſters and Churches, as a pack of Drunkards, Whoremongers, with an <hi>Et-caetera,</hi> worſe than Mountebanks; a curſed bitter Stock of Hirelings, a Pedantick Crew, the beſt to be ſpared of Mankind; againſt whom the Boiling Vengeance of God
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:65629:169"/> is reſerved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and who deſerve nothing but Plagues and Woes, Hell and Damnation; yea, Pick-pockets, Cut-purſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the People ought to ſhun as a Peſt-houſe, with too much of that Nature to be here inſerted; eſpecially, adding what in <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm, &amp;c.</hi> is ſet forthron this Head: And does it not amount to a juſt Provocation to any Child, to ſee ſuch foul Aſperſions, and horrible Slanders, caſt upon his Mother, from whoſe Breaſts of Conſolation he hath received great Conſolation and Comfort, both to vindicate her, and to ſet forth what manner of Men they are, that thus ſcandalize his Mother-Church, not only privately in their Chimney Corners, but in their Meetings; yea, in Print, in all Cities, Towns and Villages? <hi>&amp;c. G.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader,</hi> I am now about opening the <hi>Cage,</hi> and ſhall take out Twelve of the Birds, and open their Wings, and ſpread their Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the Intent thou maiſt view them, and note their Features, and obſerve their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Diſpoſitions; and <hi>George Fox</hi> the <hi>Cage-Keeper</hi> ſhall be over and above, with ſome little Obſervations upon him; and the rather, becauſe <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> has denied, That the Quakers call him their Branch, their Star, their Son of Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his <hi>Sober Expoſt.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 55, 58. I remember, that about the Year 1662. <hi>Geo. Fox</hi> came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and at his Meetings great part of his Diſcourſe was about the <hi>Cage</hi> of <hi>Unclean Birds,</hi> ſaying, The Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (as in his Epiſtle to be read in Churches)</hi> and the Profeſſors, were a <hi>Cage of Unclean Birds;</hi> and the Note he made them ſing was thus, Come ye Epiſcopals, How do you ſing in the <hi>Cage? Anſw.</hi> No Perfection here, no Perfection here. Well, come you Presbyterians, Independants, and Baptiſts, what ſay you? How do you ſing? Let us hear your Note. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No Perfection here, no Perfection here. Then ſaid <hi>George,</hi> Come out of the <hi>Cage,</hi> in a very comical Manner. Thus did he deride the Profeſſors of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, exalting themſelves; a Figure of which, you have in <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi>'s Sermon in the Thirteenth Chapter: And now you ſhall hear how his <hi>Birds</hi> chirrup, and what Note they ſing to his Lute. But to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65629:171"/> this rightly, I think it neceſſary to give you a brief Deſcription of <hi>Geo. Fox;</hi> that ſo, when you hear Six of the Birds of one ſort ſing to his Tune, and dance after his Pipe, you may the better underſtand whether they do not call him their Branch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> He <hi>(G. Fox)</hi> a great Liar, like <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet;</hi> a great Seducer, like <hi>Symon Magus,</hi> a vain Boaſter, like <hi>Ignatius Loyold,</hi> ſaying, <q rend="inline">That neither he nor his Name was known in the World;</q> 
                     <hi>Several Petitions Anſwered, &amp;c.</hi> p. 60. when there was not Ten Men in the whole Nation more univerſally known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that he taught, <q rend="inline">That he that hath the ſame Spirit that raiſed up Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is equal with God; that he was before Languages were, and that he was come to the end of Languages.</q> 
                     <hi>Saul</hi>'s <hi>Errand,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8. His <hi>Battledoor, the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that he taught, <q rend="inline">That he was come to ſuch a Fulneſs of Glory, as that his Head and Ears was filled full of Glory; yea, that a Thundering Voice anſwered him, ſaying, I have glorified thee, and will glorifie thee again;</q> alluding to <hi>John</hi> 12.28,29. <hi>The Examination and Tryal of</hi> G. Fox <hi>at</hi> Lancaſter <hi>Aſſize,</hi> &amp;c. p. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In that he ſaid, <q rend="inline">
                        <hi>David</hi>'s Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher was with the Quakers, and that they had ſeen it.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In ſaying, <hi>That if every People own the Prophets and Apoſtles Writings, they will own the Writings of the Quakers; and that they may as well condemn the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to the Fire, as their Papers and Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> &amp;c. Several Petitions Anſwered, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 38. Truth's Defence, <hi>p.</hi> 2, 104.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> In that he taught, <hi>That he wrought Miracles,</hi> Fox<hi>'s Journal, the Third Index;</hi> and yet never wrought a Miracle, in the Name of Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> all his Days; (only ſome Lying Wonders, forged out of his Luciferian Brain, without any Atteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, like <hi>Symon Magus.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In that he taught, <hi>That the Breach of the Eighth Commandment, Thou ſhalt not ſteal, was no Sin, if moved thereto by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> G. Fox<hi>'s Great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. p. 77. In this, <hi>Fox,</hi> if not a Ranter, yet joined with them; and ſo are all that own his Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> In that he taught, <hi>That to call the Scriptures the Word of God was Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;</hi> whilſt that he, yea, even he, called his own Writings the Word of God; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Word of the Lord. <hi>Way to the Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 4. <hi>Several Papers given out for ſpreading Truth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> In teaching, <hi>That if Chriſt that's Crucified be not within, and that Chriſt that's Riſen be not within, I ſay, that ye are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates. — Now, I ſay, that if there be any other Chriſt than he that's Crucified within,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65629:172"/> he is a falſe Chriſt; and he that hath not this Chriſt that was Riſen and Crucified within, is a Reprobate. Tho' Devils and Reprobates make a Talk of him without, God's Chriſt is not</hi> Diſtinct <hi>from his Saints, nor his Body, (the Church;) for he is within them, not</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct <hi>from their Spirits: And thou ſay'ſt, thou art ſaved by Chriſt without thee, and ſo hath recorded thy ſelf a Reprobate; and they that profeſs Chriſt without them, and another Chriſt within them, here is two Chriſts.</hi> G. Fox<hi>'s</hi> Great Myſtery, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 206, 207, 250, 254.</p>
                  <p>And to confirm this falſe Doctrine, ſee <hi>Edw. Burrough</hi>'s Anſwer to a Queſtion, and <hi>William Smith</hi>'s to his Child; which are as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Query, <hi>Is that very Man</hi> (ſaid the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to <hi>Burrough,) with that very Body, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you? Yea, or Nay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Burrough</hi> Anſwers, <hi>The very Chriſt of God is within us; we dare not deny him.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tongh<hi>'s</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 149.</p>
                  <p>Query, <hi>How may I know when Chriſt is truly Preached?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>W. Smith's</hi> Anſwer. <hi>They that are falſe (Miniſters) Preach Chriſt without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: But they that are Chriſt's Miniſters Preach Chriſt within,</hi> &amp;c. Smith<hi>'s</hi> Primer, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Now, Reader, if this Doctrine be ſound and Orthodox, then were all the Apoſtles,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:65629:172"/> Martyrs, and all Chriſtian Miniſters, falſe Teachers and Deceivers; but if this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine be Heterodox, then the Quakers only are the falſe Teachers, Deceivers, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſts. <hi>W. Penn</hi> alſo is one with <hi>Fox, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>Smith.</hi> See his <hi>Chriſtian Quaker, and Div. Teſt.</hi> p. 97, 98. and his <hi>Sandy Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> p. 21.</p>

                     <hi>viz. Oh thou North of</hi> England, <hi>who art counted as Deſolate and Barren, and reckoned the leaſt of the Nations; yet out of thee did the Branch</hi> (Fox) <hi>ſpring, and the Star</hi> (Fox) <hi>ariſe, which gives Light unto all the Regions round about; in thee the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (Fox) <hi>appear'd; out of thee Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets, did come forth in the Name and Power of the moſt High, (meaning</hi> Hub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berthorn, Howgil, Burrough, Farnſworth, Nayler, Atkinſon, Whitehead, <hi>&amp;c.) which uttered their Voices as Thunders,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus has <hi>Burrough</hi> ecchoed back, and confirmed <hi>Fox</hi> his Impoſture, ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to his Blaſphemy, alluding to <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. to <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.5,6. as more largely han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in my Book, <hi>New Rome Unmask'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 79, to 88. and <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6, 7.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:65629:173"/> but to make it clear, and paſt his Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if poſſible, let's take out more Birds; but he that will deny <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Book to have this Title, <hi>This is only to go amongſt Friends,</hi> which is the only, and all the Title; and which Book I have by me; what will not ſuch a Fellow deny?</p>

                     <hi>John Moone</hi> is the Tenth in number: He was an excellent Orator, a great travelling Preacher, and of great Fame amongſt the <hi>Quakers;</hi> of which I need not ſay much in this place; if the Reader be pleaſed to turn back to the Fourth Chapter, he ſhall ſee him amongſt the VVorthies one of the Eleven Elders to govern the Church, one half of them Cage-Birds; pray obſerve from thence what Judges and Elders the <hi>Quakers</hi> Body is, to which the poor Hearers muſt ſubmit; 'tis well worthy thy notice. However, after many Years Preaching, and ſuffering Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Cauſe in <hi>England,</hi> he went into <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and was a great Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there, and a Juſtice of Peace forſooth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Honourable <hi>W. Penn:</hi> But he could not leave his Vicious Habit, for he firſt got his Maid with Child, and ſo purſued that Courſe of Life until he died of the foul Diſeaſe: I would have the <hi>Quakers</hi> look into <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi>'s Sermon, and compare it with the Cage of their unclean Birds, all VVriters and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and <hi>I</hi> hope it will humble them, tho' my Verſes did not, which yet were intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; for <hi>I</hi> was loth to expoſe them, becauſe <hi>I</hi> do believe, that amongſt the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers there are many honeſt-minded People; but <hi>I</hi> verily believe, that according to the number of the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Teachers, compar'd with the Multitude of the Clergy, and other
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65629:178"/> Proteſtant Teachers: <hi>I</hi> ſay, where there is one of the laſt mention'd chargeable with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Immoralities, there is a Hundred of the <hi>Quaker</hi>-Teachers, yet how impudently have <hi>W.

                     <hi>Thomas Thurſton</hi> is the Eleventh Bird, was an eminent Preacher up of G. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Laws and Commandments, and a great Favourite of <hi>Fox</hi>'s, who liv'd in <hi>America;</hi> who in his Travels to ſpread their Truth, pretended to the Deputy-Governor's VVife, that he <hi>(Tho.

                  <p>Come, <hi>George,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of thy Brother Preacher, <hi>Tho.

                  <p>Come, <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> this is high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; but he was a Man for your turn, one ſtrict for <hi>G.

                        <hi>George Smith,</hi> the Twelfth Bird.</note> 
                     <hi>George Smith</hi> of <hi>Littleport,</hi> having a Wife of his own, being a Bailiff for a Gentleman of the ſame Town, (whoſe Wife was a handſome young Woman) <hi>G. Smith</hi> in time grew very kind to his Wife; the Gentleman falling ſick, gave his Wife warning of <hi>G. Smith:</hi> But he dying, there was room for him to accompliſh his Deſign; and ſo it came to paſs, that he got her with Child: And the time of her Delivery drawing near, <hi>George</hi> takes his Horſe, and carries the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow forth, deſigning ſuch a Journey, as that her Child ſhould not be heard to cry in <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> nor Tales thereof be told to the World's People. Well, away they rode together lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, as if they had been acquainted; but e'er they got two Miles, the good Woman had a Fit of the Belly-ake; and riding paſt a lone Houſe, called <hi>Woodhouſe,</hi> ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Littleport</hi> and <hi>Ely, G. Smith</hi> knocks at the Door, the 10th or 12th Day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1684. upon which came out the good Man, <hi>i. e. William Pooley,</hi> (ſtill living:) What would you have, Neighbour <hi>Smith?</hi> (ſays <hi>Pooley</hi>) I deſire to come in, (ſaid <hi>George</hi>) my Friend behind me is not well. Upon which, out comes the good Woman of the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65629:181"/> Houſe, ſaying, We are preparing our Cheeſe for <hi>Sturbech-Fair:</hi> Oh! (ſaid <hi>George</hi>) Pray Neighbour <hi>Pooley</hi> let us come in, I will give you any Content. Upon which the Man took down the Woman, who ask'd, ſaying, Have you not a private Room? Yes, ſaid the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the Houſe, a Parlour; none like it, thought the Sick Woman. So in they went, the Sick Woman, Goody <hi>Pooley,</hi> and her Maid, and in half an Hour's time was born to <hi>G. Smith</hi> a Son; <hi>George</hi> praying Secrecy<note n="*" place="margin">Pray mind the Quaker's Method; keep things pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and all is well.</note>, and he would pay them well. So away goes <hi>G. Smith</hi> home to his old Wife, and all things were huſh and ſtill as Heart could wiſh, and about a Week or Ten Days after home goes the Woman as ſound as a Roach; and at the Months end, when the Babe had gotten a little Strength, <hi>G. Smith</hi> comes again to Goodman <hi>Pooley</hi> and his Wife, and begs heartily for their Aſſiſtance, and no doubt, with this Nod, ☞ as their uſual way is, <hi>I pray for Truth's ſake be private, leſt it get Air, for the Apoſtate Chriſtians will make a mock at it.</hi> Well, <hi>G. Smith</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to give them Five Pound to carry it 20 Miles, namely, to <hi>Great Saxum,</hi> within two Miles of <hi>Bury St. Edmunds</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> Content, ſaid they; ſo away they went by <hi>Ely, Soham,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Deaſnidge-Lodge,</hi> where they ſtay'd one Night or two, whilſt <hi>G. Smith</hi> went before to provide a Nurſe, which he ſoon did at <hi>Saxum</hi> aforeſaid: For Money anſwers all things.</p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:65629:182"/>
                  <p>Well, the place being prepared, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, away goes <hi>Pooley</hi> and his Wife with the Child, and delivered it to the Wife of <hi>John Chapman</hi> of <hi>Saxum</hi> aforeſaid, as the Act and Deed of <hi>G. Smith.</hi> But as ſoon as <hi>Pooley</hi> and his Wife had eat and drank, tho' wet and weary, <hi>G. Smith</hi> pack'd them away, leſt the old and new Nurſe ſhould have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tittle Tattle together: But Goodman <hi>Chapman</hi> being not yet come from <hi>Bury</hi> with the Writings, which were made in the Name of one Mr. <hi>Turner</hi> of <hi>Wretham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Forgery; for I went to both the <hi>Wrethams,</hi> and there is not a Man lives there of that Name.</note>, as Father of the Child, who was called by <hi>G. Smith, Robert Turner;</hi> but ſaid the new Nurſe, Is the Child Baptized? Ay, ay, ſays <hi>George,</hi> all is done, all is done. So <hi>G. Smith</hi> himſelf ſtay'd; and having diſpatch'd away <hi>Pooley</hi> and his Wife, he bought Nuts, and crack'd, and at laſt came Goodman <hi>Chapman</hi> with the ſaid Writings; which, upon his paying 40 <hi>l</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tho' he fell ſhort about 10 <hi>s.</hi> which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend, but did not.</note>. were ſealed, and away goes <hi>George</hi> jogging home as merry as a Cricket.</p>
                  <p>This is <hi>G. Whithead</hi>'s well-meaning Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed, the ſaid <hi>G.

                  <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since all now is ſettled, and well, and private, that the World's People
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65629:182"/> do not know of it, (for that with them, in all the like Caſes, is the Principal <hi>Verb,) George</hi> and his Widow grew kind again, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the ſame Converſation as formerly, at laſt ſhe Conceives, and grew big<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>G.

Hall,</hi> and another faithful Friend; and the time being come, to work they went, and in a little time ſhe was delivered of a Daughter: And when the Child attain'd to the Age of about half an Hour, being a little dreſt up, <hi>G. Smith</hi> the Father, and <hi>Eleanor Hall</hi> the Midwife, carried the Child at the Age aforeſaid to a lone Houſe, ſtanding in the Field, called the <hi>Brick-Kill-Houſe,</hi> a frequent Harbour for Beggars, ſince out of uſe; and in goes the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Eleanor</hi> with this Infant, under the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Promiſe of <hi>George</hi> to gratifie her for all her Trouble, Care and Pains, and to ſend her and his Child Suſtenance: Ay, ay, that he would; having already ſent out <hi>G.

Amends for your Crime, and extenuate the Heinouſneſs of your Offence; for it ſeems to me a moſt horrible Crime, beſides the Sin; and as an Aggravation thereof, to beget Children, and ſend them into the World as Vagrants, they being from under the Verge of the Law, and can be Heirs of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Shame of their Parents; which altho' they cannot help it, yet muſt they wear
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:65629:184"/> the Badge and Livery thereof as long as they live. If you anſwer my Expectation in this Matter, as I have hitherto been ſparing of you, ſo I ſhall make no Complaint to any Juſtice of the Peace; if not, you may depend on it; if God give me length of Days, I ſhall do what I legally can, to have ſomething ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on them: And therefore let me have your Anſwer.</p>

                  <p>Come, <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> VVhat think you of theſe Things? VVhere is your Seriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? VVhere is your Sincerity? You told me that your God laid a Neceſſity upon you to write againſt me and others, wherein you call'd me <hi>Apoſtate Informer, Devil Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Beaſt, Dog, Wolf,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Epiſtle to Judgment fixed.</note> But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned you ſooth up, as well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and upright Lambs, and never writ a Book againſt them, yet three Books againſt me in Nine Months time: And, <hi>George,</hi> then you were Rampant; you neither ſtudied Events, nor feared Effects; you were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go on, come what will come; you were reſolved to Unchriſtian all that oppoſed you, and ſeparated from you; you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ruin them, if poſſible, both in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:65629:184"/> Name, Reputation and Eſtate; I have felt the weight of your Hand, and the Strength of your Indignation, and implacable Malice; but bleſſed be the God, and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that amongſt his manifold Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to me, that he hath vouchſafed to give me Time and Ability to return your ſharp Arrows back into your own Boſoms; and I let them fly freely, I am not ſparing; for as <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath opened his Armory, and hath brought forth the Weapons of his Indignation,</hi> Jer. 50.24. And, <hi>George,</hi> they will light on the Skirts of this Painted Harlot, and all thy Jeſuitical Craft cannot throw it off; for your Cauſe is drooping. I have given you the Key of the Cage, look into it, and you may ſee the Abominations of the Earth, even the Myſtery of Iniquity. VVell, <hi>George,</hi> after it came into my Heart to write this Book, I ſaid, <hi>Shall I ſpare them any longer?</hi> Concluding, <hi>No: But give this Harlot a double Cup, and make her drink the very Dregs of it:</hi> And having laid faſt hold of the two main Pillars, upon which your Building ſtands, <hi>viz.</hi> INFALLIBILITY and PERFECTION, I did with all my Might ſhake, <hi>Judges</hi> 26.29. and behold it begins to tumble: For, <hi>George,</hi> the time is come, that one ſhall chaſe a Thouſand, and two ſhall put Ten Thouſand to flight, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.30.

               <argument>
                  <p>Sheweth the Enmity of the <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt me, for my Teſtimony againſt their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and the Providence of God ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting me under my Sufferings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT is not unknown to many of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers ſtill alive, with what Zeal and Care, with what Sufferings, by Fines and Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65629:185"/> with what Pains and Charge I was in divers Kinds exerciſed whilſt I was a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and that for the carrying on the Cauſe of Quakeriſm; nothing ſeemed dear to me to part withal, or to ſpend, for the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof: But when I came to ſee them walk contrary to what they pretended, and that their ſeeming Sincerity was real Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, I then began to look into things, that there might be a Reformation; and the firſt thing that gave me occaſion was, ſee <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8. That of forcing Apprentices to ſtand bareheaded in their Houſes and Shops, and yet at the ſame time pretended they could not put off their Hats in reſpect to Perſons. This looked ſo bad, <hi>i. e.</hi> to receive, nay, exact Reſpect from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors, and not to give it to our Superiors, that I wrote a Letter to the Yearly Meeting, in <hi>May</hi> 1675. as a Teſtimony againſt it, which gave great Offence.</p>
               <p>The next which gave Offence to me and others, was our Teachers, who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort us to be bold, to give up all, telling us, <hi>The Fleece would grow again;</hi> who themſelves at the ſame time would give up nothing, nay, not ſet themſelves in a like ſuffering Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city with the Hearers, inſomuch, as that in the Loſs of 13550 <hi>l.</hi> our Teachers never loſt 50 <hi>l.</hi> but the Hearers ſuffer'd for them, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for themſelves. See <hi>Painted Harlot,</hi> &amp;c. p. 5. And this I ſaw, and ſpake againſt ſome Months before it fell to my turn to be Fined
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:65629:186"/> for our Preachers: But at laſt I was ſined 15 <hi>l.</hi> for <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> for that he did not declare his Name and Habitation, and thereby put himſelf in a like Suffering Capacity with us the Hearers, as I ſhewed at large; ſee <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Railing,</hi> &amp;c. p. 73, to 80. and how I proſecuted the Reſtitution of the ſaid Fine of 15 <hi>l.</hi> and had it again, tho' with great Loſs, by Charges, Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing which gave me Offence, was <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s ſetting up a Female Government, by VVomen's Meeting Monthly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I oppoſed vigorouſly; and to be ſhort, I do think I gave (by my Book) that Image a deadly Blow: <hi>De Chriſ. Lib.</hi> &amp;c. Part 2d. But by this time, <hi>G. Whitehead, Sam. Cater, R. S.</hi> and others, wrote ſeveral Books againſt me, wherein they called me, <hi>A Child of the Devil, Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, an Apoſtate, a Betraying</hi> Judas, <hi>a Treacherous Hypocrite, a Dog, a Wolf, a Beaſt, an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> 18 or 20 times in one Book, intituled, <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Lib. of an Apoſt. Conſ.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Righteous Judgment placed,</hi> &amp;c. with abundance more ſuch Stuff. VVell, upon this I apply'd my ſelf to our <hi>Milden-Hall</hi> Meeting, for a Certificate againſt theſe ſcandalous Detractions, (which they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Printed, but ſent up and down into all Counties where I dealt, particularly into <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire,</hi> in order to ruin my Reputation<note n="*" place="margin">Which then was a moſt hateful Name amongſt Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note>.) VVell, Twenty-ſeven Members of this Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gave me a Certificate, many of them
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65629:186"/> ſtill alive; and both then and ſtill the chief Men of the Meeting. See <hi>New Rome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epiſt. to the</hi> Bereans, <hi>and Introd.</hi> See <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> &amp;c. 2d. Part, <hi>p.</hi> 146. <note place="margin">Theſe Books they ſtill ſent into every County, which did me much hurt in my Trade.</note> And this Certificate, with the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Books I wrote, ſo maul'd them, that <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> and his Aſſiſtants, gave over: But <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> he ſtill goes on, he wrote ſometimes three Books in leſs than a Year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, calling me, <hi>Self-condemned Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Counterfeit Convert, a Scandal to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, a Fool, and Novice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And when this would not effect their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Deſign, then they ſent Letters about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, and raiſed all manner of Lies and Stories; and by Poſt, ſent me not only Books wrote againſt <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> but Letters alſo.

I am likewiſe to let you know, that notwithſtanding they pretended to the Parliament, that they cannot ſeek Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for themſelves, and thereupon could not Sign the Aſſociation, yet they Indicted me for Printing Unlicenſed, (whilſt it's their own frequent Practice) in the <hi>Old-Baily, London,</hi> which put me to great Charge; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as one way or other, by my attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Controverſie, by Writing and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; firſt, by oppoſing their Errours; next, by vindicating my ſelf from their repeated Abuſes, both Publickly and Privately, both as a Man and Chriſtian, I did come by great Loſs in my outward Eſtate; and when Men perceived it, they came ſo faſt upon me, as that <hi>I</hi> could not bear up. See <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> p. 79. I do not in all Caſes juſtifie my ſelf, in the too much neglecting my Buſineſs, to attend the Motion of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are a compacted Corporation, and my ſelf a ſingle Perſon, there was too much odds: But I met with ſuch Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which would fill a Volume to relate; and thereupon I came to ſee my Fall by the Hand of <hi>Saul;</hi> for the Sons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah</hi> were too hard for me: For I had
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65629:188"/> maintained the Conteſt without the Help of the Clergy from 1675, to the Year 1697. and in all that time, I never receiv'd of any one, or more of them, Ten Shillings, nor Ten Nights Lodgings: And whereas they now call me Mercenary, becauſe I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Clergy's Kindneſs, which has been very Bountiful; let any <hi>Quaker</hi> of them all ſhew me that he have waged War at his own Charge and Coſt, ſo long, and at ſo much Expence, Coſt, Labour, Pains, Charge and Trouble, and I will not from henceforth call him Mercenary; but their Tongue is no Slander; and now I ſhall ſhew ſomewhat of the wonderful Providence of God, in my Preſervation to this Day. For when I found how the Caſe ſtood with me, I waited Two or Three Months under ſome Heavineſs and Concern, hearing from all Quarters how the <hi>Quakers</hi> glory'd over me; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were the chief Cauſe of my Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, not only with reſpect to the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, but by Six or Eight of them breaking in my Debt: Upon which I went to viſit Mr. <hi>Eraſmus Warren,</hi> a neighbouring Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and told him my Condition; and he ſpake comfortably to me, and bad me not be diſcouraged, for God was All-ſufficient, and that the Earth was the Lord's, and the Fulneſs thereof, or to this purpoſe; and told me, that if I would write a Letter of Requeſt to my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> he and ſome others would ſign it. <hi>I</hi> did ſo, and it was ſigned
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65629:188"/> by himſelf, Mr. <hi>Archer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Davis, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>I</hi> went to <hi>Norwich,</hi> and did, with no little Heavineſs, preſume to go with it to my Lord Biſhop, of whom <hi>I</hi> did rather expect ſome little chiding, (being ſenſible of my own Fault) than to be ſo kindly receiv'd: But when <hi>I</hi> came to him, he examined me about my Condition, and preſs'd me to be honeſt, and to pay as far as <hi>I</hi> was able. For <hi>(ſaid he)</hi> our Religion teacheth us to do Right and Juſtly by all Men; and when you have done, reſt upon God's Providence; it is not your Caſe alone; Times have been hard, and Diſappointments many: And then asked me what <hi>I</hi> would have him do for me; <hi>I</hi> told him, that if his Lordſhip would pleaſe to give me a Certificate of his Thoughts of me; <hi>I</hi>w as minded to make Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to my Lords, the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the two Univerſities, and to ſome particular Clergy-men. All which <hi>I</hi> no ſooner asked than he granted me; and it pleaſed God ſo to open the Hearts of my Lords, the Biſhops, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read Clergy, that <hi>I</hi> found Help in time of Need; and when it was in my Heart to write this Book, <hi>I</hi> asked one of my Lords, the Biſhops, Leave, to give ſome Publick Acknowledgment of their Kindneſs; but he anſwer'd me, <hi>No, go thy ways home, and be thankful, we deſire no ſuch thing:</hi> But read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and finding in St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, Chap. 1. 44, 55. that when
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:65629:189"/> Chriſt healed the Leper, he charged him, ſaying, <hi>See thou ſay nothing to any Man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But he</hi> (the Leper, being cured) <hi>went out, and began to publiſh it much, and to blaze abroad the Matter;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> never read that Chriſt blamed the Man for his Gratitude; and <hi>I</hi> truſt, no more will his Miniſters and Servants, for this my Preſumption: For how can <hi>I</hi> receive ſuch unexpected and unmeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Favours, and not blaze it abroad? <hi>I,</hi> that for about Twenty Years Perſecuted the Church, and drew Diſciples after me<note n="†" place="margin">I know of no one Man drew more.</note>, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Schiſm of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and yet upon my Return met with no upbraiding, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, like the returning Prodigal, am met half way, and loaden with Kindneſſes. Surely this is of the Lord's doing, (and it is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous in my Eye) to whom be the Praiſe of all his Mercies and Providences, now, and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>I</hi> humbly thank them, they were very kind to me, notwithſtanding all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to repreſent me unworthy of their Notice; particularly at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where they carry'd to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Books againſt me, which <hi>I</hi> had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd and refuted Ten or Fifteen Years ſince; inſomuch that ſome of the Heads of the Colledges took ſpecial Notice of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Malice, and thereupon I do believe were the more kind. Thus doth God bring Good out of Evil; nay, ſhould I relate all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Methods the <hi>Quakers</hi> uſed in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where I came, to prevent me of their Kindneſs, and the Aboundings of the Favours I received, it would ſeem almoſt incredible, I being but a ſingle Perſon, and known but to a few; the <hi>Quakers</hi> numerous, and (like the Followers of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Numb.</hi> 16.2.) Men of Fame in ſome Caſes. But ſo it was they did not prevail; but God in his Providence made way for my Deliverance, beyond my Expectation, and in him do I truſt, who taketh Care of the Sparrows, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29,30,31. and this puts me in Mind of the Widow, recorded in the Holy Scriptures, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. whoſe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band died, and left her in Debt, and not Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to anſwer, inſomuch that the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was come to take away her two Sons. This poor Woman was no doubt in Diſtreſs enough; but yet ſhe neither exclaimed of her Husband, nor yet murmur'd at the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65629:191"/> of Providence which befel; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did ſhe ſit ſtill, and uſe no Means: But hearing that <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet was come to Town, ſhe reſolves to make Application to him; he could but deny her; ſhe knew the worſt, and hoped the beſt; and therefore in Faith, and full Aſſurance of the Mercy of God to them that truſt in him; and not doubting but the Inſpired Prophet knew her Inſide, even the Sincerity of her Heart; and that notwithſtanding this Calamity, ſhe could appeal to him, that her Husband was an honeſt Man, a Man that feared God, and ſerved him in Uprightneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe puts on Courage, and goes to him, ſaying, <hi>Thy Servant, my Husband, is dead, and thou knoweſt that thy Servant did fear the Lord, and the Creditor is come to take unto him my two Sons to be Bondſmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſorrowful News (no doubt) to the Prophet, to hear that one of the Sons of the Prophets, that profeſſed Faith in the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſo fail, as not to be able to pay his Debts. Well, the Prophet quickly underſtood the Widow, and as quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, ſaying, <hi>What ſhall I do for thee? tell me: What haſt thou in the Houſe?</hi> Here is two notable Queſtions, and ſo quickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he did not give the Widow leave to anſwer to the firſt, but added, <hi>What haſt thou in the Houſe?</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Why ſhould I ask this humble Petitioner, what ſhe would have me to do?</hi> 'Tis plain,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65629:192"/> ſhe would willingly be enabled to pay her Debts, reſcue her two Sons, and have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to live on; ſhe then reply'd, ſaying, <hi>Thine Handmaid hath nothing at home, ſave a Pitcher of Oyl.</hi> Upon which the Prophet (as God would have it) wrought a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſaying, <hi>Go borrow the Veſſels of all thy Neighbours, even empty Veſſels; borrow not a few; and when thou art come into thy Houſe, ſhut the Door upon thee, and upon thy Sons, and pour out into all theſe Veſſels, and ſet aſide that which is full.</hi> She did ſo, and was thereby enabled to pay her Debts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem her Sons, and had left wherewithal to live upon. O the wonderful Works of God! who thus inſtructs his to depend upon his Providence; for the Scriptures are written for our Learning; and truly, when I conſider my own Caſe, I think it falls not much ſhort of this Miracle; I am ſure <hi>I</hi> have met with a wonderful Providence in my Deliverance, conſidering <hi>I</hi> had no ſuch inſpired Prophet to appeal to, nor ſuch an Evidence to vouch on my part: I had nothing but Reaſon and Demonſtration to offer, having prayed to God to incline the Hearts of his Servants to a Charitable Conſideration of Things paſt, preſent, and to come: Nay, my Caſe ſeem'd worſe than the Widow's; for I do not read that ſhe had any Enemies to Interpoſe, but I had many. The <hi>Quakers</hi> no ſooner underſtood that the Clergy took my Caſe into their Pious Confideration, but they ſent their Emiſſaries
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:65629:192"/> with Books after me, both to the Colledges, and particular Perſons; wherein I was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented an Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, a Child of the Devil; yea, a Devil Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, a Wolf, a Dog, a Beaſt, <hi>&amp;c. Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fixed,</hi> &amp;c. by <hi>G.

See his Book, <hi>A Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, a Scandal to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> &amp;c.</note>; and to make this out, they told ſome of the Reverend Clergy in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that tho' <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> pretended to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> yet he never receiv'd the Communion with you.

               <p>Friends, <hi>This is the</hi> 15th. <hi>Year ſince I came to this Meeting for a Certificate on my Behalf again the Suggeſtions of</hi> S. Cater <hi>and</hi> Geo. Whitehead, &amp;c. <hi>which were, That I was an Informer;</hi> which at that time was a hateful Name to a Tradeſman, and very Prejudicial to my Reputation, as well as divers other Falſe and Scandalous Detractions in their Books. And this Meeting (at leaſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of it, Twenty-ſeven in number) gave me ONE <note n="*" place="margin">As in <hi>The Picture of Quakeriſm,</hi> Part 2. p. 146.</note> with great Courage and Freedom, which at that time was very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and <hi>I</hi> now come to you for a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication againſt my ſelf, and ask no Favour at your Hands, touching ſeveral Reports raiſed on me, <hi>Ut ſupra;</hi> and upon your ſigning it with your Names, <hi>I</hi> promiſe to print it; and what <hi>I</hi> cannot juſtly deny, <hi>I</hi> will fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs.</p>
               <p>But ſeveral anſwer'd me, (and not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the reſt, or any of them) That they never heard any ſuch Report, nor knew any cauſe why there ſhould be ſuch Reports.</p>
               <p>But for the farther clearing the Matter, and removing Stumbling-Blocks out of the way, <hi>I</hi> ſhall recite the Subſtance of ſeveral Certificates, which <hi>I</hi> took FROM my Son, (who, tho' one of them, yet <hi>I</hi> hope he is ſincere; for <hi>I</hi> have heard him ſay, and that before ſome <hi>Quakers, Come, what is Wrong

FROM <hi>William Belſham,</hi> who was my Servant 15 or 16 Years, and is a Quaker, and one that handed my Certificate above-mention'd in 1683. a Man of known Reputation. FROM <hi>Matthew Belſham,</hi> his Brother, both living well, each having ſome Eſtate of their own: He was my Servant about 16 Years, tho' none of them at this time; who, if I were ſuch a Perſon as ſome would repreſent me to be, ſome, if not all of theſe, muſt know ſomething of it. Nay, I do believe I could have had a Hundred of my Neighbours to avouch the ſame, ſo far as my Actions have come under their Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance: But theſe being Perſons of Credit, and that have had Experience of my manner of Life, may (I think) ballance thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, whoſe Authors cannot be found out: And indeed, were it not for the ſake of my Teſtimony, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> would wound thro' my Sides, I ſhould not have ſaid ſo much on this Subject, but rather have taken <hi>David</hi>'s Patience for my Example; who, when <hi>Shimei</hi> curſed and reproached him in

                  <hi>Reader,</hi> As I could not paſs by ſuch Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mercies and Benefits as I have received, without ſome Publick Acknowledgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Ingratitude both to God and Man, ſo would <hi>I</hi> not be too particular, leſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>I</hi> do offend; yet with St. <hi>Paul</hi> I can ſay, That as Sufferings and hard Uſage formy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony-ſake abound, ſo do not only Inward Conſolation, but Outward Benefits abound alſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. and as a Proof thereof, I ſhall add but one Inſtance more, which is, That ſince I came to <hi>London,</hi> an Ancient Friend of mine, to whom I did owe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Debt upon Bond, who conſidering the hard Uſages <hi>I</hi> have received from the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> (in which he himſelf has had a deep ſhare) and finding me ſtill conſcientiouſly concern'd, without my asking, or once thinking of, or expecting, brought me the Bond, and forgave me the Debt reſting due to him upon it, without any Covenant or Promiſe on my part. Thus hath God open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hearts of his Servants, and moved them to Compaſſion; Bleſſed be his Holy Name for ever, and Humble Thanks to all, unto whom I have been oblig'd.</p>

               <p>HAving given you a Brief Account of my Travel in this Pilgrimage, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the many Turnings and Windings which I have gone through, and the many Quickſands and Quagmires that I have paſſed without ſinking, tho' oft-times in great Danger; what by Enemies within, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without, as alſo in ſome Places pointed to <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s Rock, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> I am now come to remove one Stumbling-block, which <hi>Solomon Eccles</hi> has laid in your way, namely, <hi>That there is as great a Gulf fixed between you and the Chriſtians, as there was between</hi> Dives <hi>and</hi> Abraham, inſomuch, that if you would come from them, i. e. <hi>Quakers,</hi> you cannot; his Words are theſe, <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p>Again, as an Explanation of this Doctrine, he ſaith, <hi>Come Proteſtants, Presbyterians, Independants and Baptiſts, the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny you all: — The</hi> Quakers <hi>are in the Truth, and none but they,</hi> &amp;c. The Quakers Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>And from this, and the like Doctrine, ſpring that Averſion in you, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to prevail with many of you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to hear a Sermon, preach'd by the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſters, or to read their Sermons: So that when the <hi>Quakers</hi> once catch any in their Cobweb, it is very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to get you out, unleſs here and there one, that is reſolv'd to obſerve the Apoſtle's Advice, who ſaid, <hi>Prove all things, holdfaſt that which is good,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. And <hi>I</hi> am not doubtful, but that as there has been a Remnant that has taken this Advice, and has forſaken the <hi>Quakers</hi> Errors, ſo will there many more follow their Example: For this Doctrine of theirs, which alludes to Chriſt's Parable, is falſly applied; for that Parable relates to the Final Eſtate of the Bleſſed, and the Damned, after this Life, as you may read at large, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. And as for the <hi>Quakers</hi> denying all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity, affirming themſelves to be in the <hi>Truth</hi> Only, or the Only
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:65629:197"/> Church of Chriſt, as in my former Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, <hi>viz.

I</hi> well remember, that when <hi>I</hi> firſt heard it Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd, that <hi>G. Fox</hi> was looked upon as a ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> to give forth Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for us to walk by, and Methods and Forms of Church-Government, I preſently wrote Six Queries touching Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in the Year 1678<note n="*" place="margin">22 Years ſince.</note>. which went in Manuſcript far and near, as Printed in my Book, intituled, <hi>De Chriſ. Lib.</hi> Part 2. Page 72, 80. the Tenor of which was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 1. Whether Jeſus Chriſt be Head of the Church, or <hi>George Fox?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 2. If you ſay Chriſt; then whether he be not Lawgiver to his Church?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 3. If you ſay, that Chriſt is both Head and Lawgiver to his Church; then whether we ought not to Follow and Obey the Commands and Precepts of Chriſt, which are laid down in the Scripture by the four Evangeliſts, and his Apoſtles, rather than the Commands and Precepts of <hi>G. Fox?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:65629:198"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 4. If you ſay, that the Commands and Precepts of Chriſt ought rather to be obey'd, than thoſe of <hi>Geo. Fox;</hi> then <hi>I</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Query, whether Chriſt, or any of his Apoſtles, ever commanded the Obſervation of <hi>Womens Meetings,</hi> apart and diſtinct from the Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 5. If you ſay, that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles commanded nor left any Example or Preſident for <hi>Womens Diſtinct Meetings,</hi> to be ſet up Monthly, any way to intermeddle with the Government of the Church; then <hi>I</hi> further Query, where have <hi>George Fox</hi> or you your Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to Inſtitute and Ordain ſuch a way of Government? And in whoſe Name do you compel to a Conformity, and thus to impoſe your Ceremonies? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 6. Whether were not the <hi>Bereans</hi> accounted noble, in that they ſearched the Scriptures, to ſee whether what St. <hi>Paul</hi> taught did accord therewith? And will it not become us to do the like, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what <hi>George Fox</hi> impoſes on us, accord with the Scripture? If not, whether we are obliged to obſerve his Dictates and Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, <hi>Yea or Nay?</hi> &amp;c. To which Queries <hi>I</hi> never received any Anſwer.</p>
               <p>And thus it pleaſed God of his Infinite Mercy, to give me Courage and Boldneſs 22 Years ſince, (for it was ſome Years before<note n="†" place="margin">Yea, it was <hi>May</hi> 17. 1675. See <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8.</note>, that <hi>I</hi> wrote to their Yearly Meeting, about their forcing their Apprentices to ſtand

Fox, <hi>or</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>or any other Man? I will ſtand by no Man, nor no Principle, nor no People</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Such a Man I have not found amongſt their Teachers. <hi>Tho. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pſhot</hi> came near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; but when I came to ask him, whether he would juſtifie their Books? He flew off, ſaying, No, he would not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</note>, <hi>farther than they are right; at leaſt, in my Apprehenſion, no farther than they agree with the Holy Scriptures: No, I am not yet Ear-bored to this nor the other Man, Form or Society, for Self-Ends, for Advantage in Trade, for a Name among Men; no, I am for Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo far as I know it.</hi> I thank God thus it was with me, when <hi>I</hi> was as Famous amongſt them, as ſince they have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render me Infamous; and <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire no more of the <hi>Quakers</hi> than this, let their Errors be never ſo great, and their Underſtanding never ſo clouded, if they be Sincere, and willing to be informed, <hi>I</hi> could heartily imbrace them, and for which <hi>I</hi> have great Reaſon; for <hi>I</hi> was as erroneous in many things as the moſt of them: But when I find that <hi>G. Whitehead</hi> teach them, firſt, <hi>That the Quakers are the true Church;</hi> next, <hi>That they are to believe as this true Church believes;</hi> [See his <hi>Apoſt. Incend.</hi> &amp;c. p. 3, 16.]
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:65629:199"/> and that the People love to have it ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> like Teacher, like People, the Blind to lead the Blind, till both fall into the Ditch of Error and Hereſie together; this is ſad.</p>
               <p>But ſays <hi>Geo. Whitehead, No ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; I challenge</hi> Francis Bugg, <hi>and his Teachers, Abettors, and Congratulators, to produce thoſe Books of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>with the Pages and Words, wherein we deny the ſame Jeſus that was Born of the Virgin</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>otherwiſe Retract and Condemn this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious Aſperſion.</hi> A Sober Expoſtulation with ſome of the Clergy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 46.</p>
               <p>This bold Challenge has been often An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd in <hi>The Snake in the Graſs,</hi> 3d. Edit. p. 129, to 145. <hi>Satan Diſrob'd,</hi> &amp;c. p. 8, 9, 13, 14. <hi>Gleanings,</hi> p. 2. and ſo fully, as I cannot pretend to; yet ſince this Error of the <hi>Quakers</hi> denying Chriſt ſeems to be the Mother of all their other Errors, I ſhall for this Challenge ſake, that ſo his Diſciples may ſee his Impudence, herein alſo prove, that they (i. e. <hi>Quakers</hi>) do deny the <hi>ſame Jeſus</hi> that was Born of that Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> And if I do ſo, I think he is obliged to Retract his Errors, and Condemn the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books, which ſo teach, by the ſame Rule of Arguing, <hi>viz.</hi> That both <hi>I</hi> and my Abettors ought to condemn the Calumny caſt on the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> by ſuch a Charge, if not true. And now to the Matter: <hi>When Jeſus came into the Coaſt of</hi> Ceſarea Philippi, <hi>he asked his
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:65629:199"/> Diſciples, ſaying, whom do Men ſay that I THE SON OF MAN am?</hi> Matth. 16.13.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Simon Peter</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, THOU art CHRIST, the SON of the LIVING GOD, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>Again,</hi> And WE believe, and ARE SURE, that thou art THAT CHRIST, the SON of the LIVING GOD, <hi>John</hi> 6.69.</q>
               <q>That the outward Perſon that ſuffer'd was properly the Son of God, we utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. A Body haſt thou prepared me, ſaid the Son. Then the Son was not the Body, tho' the Body was the Son's. <hi>A Serious Apol.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by</hi> Will. Penn, p. 146.</q>
               <p>Here you have the Queſtion propoſed by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Whom do Men ſay that I the SON OF MAN AM?</hi> You alſo hear St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Anſwer, which is as plain, and as home to the Purpoſe as can be; and now you ſhall hear Chriſt's Approbation and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof: But you ſee the <hi>Quakers</hi> Anſwer is point-blank contrary; yea, <hi>Will. Penn</hi> does utterly deny, <hi>That Perſon</hi> who ſuffer'd at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the <hi>SON OF GOD.</hi> Mark, <hi>Reader,</hi> Chriſt's Reply to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Anſwer to his moſt Gracious Queſtion, <hi>viz. And Jeſus anſwer'd and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-jona, <hi>for Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. 16.17. and 17.5.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:65629:200"/>
               <p>I think I need ſay no more, eſpecially ſince this Point is ſo largely handled, and ſo fully proved upon the <hi>Quakers</hi> by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Author, in the Books above-quoted: Only thus much <hi>I</hi> may add, That if St. <hi>Peter</hi> be Orthodox in this Point, then are the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Heterodox; and that herein their utter Teſtimony is levell'd, and ſtrikes at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foundation of Chriſtianity; and as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to <hi>G. W.</hi> I do offer <hi>De Novo,</hi> to prove the ſame; and <hi>I</hi> do now affirm, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> by their Books do deny the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary; The Same Jeſus,</hi> to whom the Voice came from the excellent Glory, ſaying, <hi>This is my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him: The Same Jeſus</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>The Same Jeſus</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> teſtified, ſaying, <hi>Let the Houſe of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>know aſſuredly, that God hath made that</hi> Same Jeſus <hi>whom ye have</hi> Crucified, <hi>both</hi> Lord <hi>and</hi> Chriſt. And this <hi>I</hi> offer to prove to <hi>G.

Leeds,</hi> who has been a Quaker about 22 Years.</note> which is come lately out of <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> Printed 1697. and for the Uſefulneſs of it <hi>I</hi> could be glad that it was reprinted, with this Title, <hi>A Trumpet ſounding from</hi> Penſilvania, <hi>giving an Alarum to the Magiſtrates and People of</hi> England <hi>to beware of Quakeriſm:</hi> That ſo, not only the Juſtices of the Peace, but even our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patriots, might have one put into
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65629:201"/> their Hands: But all things in their Seaſon; Quakeriſm had a time to advance, and it muſt have a time to fall: But as no Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſince the Days of Chriſt ever roſe ſo faſt, prevailed ſo much, nor carried on with ſo much Craft, and curious Paint, ſo none ever fell ſo faſt (as I am perſwaded this of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm will do) inſomuch, as that in a few Years it will be a Shame for any Man of Senſe to appear in the Streets, who owns the Principles and Practice of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> according to their Ancient Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>And now a Hint out of the <hi>Penſilvanian</hi> Book aforeſaid, intituled, <hi>News of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding,</hi> &amp;c. p. 21. viz. <hi>Tho' they (i. e.</hi> Quakers) <hi>claſh between their Old and New Teſtimonies, yet we ſee (ſays</hi> D. Leeds) <hi>that they have in their late Books dropt here and there ſome Chriſtian Expreſſions, more than formerly: And what may we think they intend thereby? Why,</hi> Geo. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head <hi>in his</hi> Counterfeit Convert, p. 72. <hi>ſays, I may ſee Cauſe otherwiſe to word the Matter, and yet our Intentions be the ſame. Now is it not admirable that a Man of</hi> Geo. Whitehead<hi>'s Pretences</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">To Seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to Sincerity, to Reality, to Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, to Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, to Plainneſs, <hi>&amp;c. Ib.</hi> 42.</note>, <hi>ſhould be grown ſo bold in Crafty and Deceivable Gloſſes, to deceive his Readers? Is this like the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Simplicity of the</hi> Quakers, <hi>to ſay, I may ſee Cauſe otherwiſe to word the Matter, and yet intend the ſame? Pray who knows then when ſuch a Man is ſincere, or bow to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:65629:202"/> him in what he ſays; that thus hides his Meanings, ſays one thing, and means another?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And now I cannot but expect (ſays</hi> Daniel, p. 42.) <hi>that there will be great Deviſing, Pulling and Drawing, (Painting and Gloſſing) rather than make Confeſſion of their Errors, Confuſion, and Contradictions herein Manifeſted and Charged, (as alſo in other Books, by</hi> Geo. Keith, Tho. Criſp, Fr. Bugg, <hi>and others) becauſe they have ſo much accuſed their Opponents for the ſame things, (themſelves are now juſtly charged with) ſurely ſome curious Wire-drawing, Mincing, Mangling, otherwiſe Wording and Equivocating</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>G. W.</hi> You muſt now call your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and your whole Society of Jeſuitical Scribes, for the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum is ſounded in your Pope's Borders.</note>, <hi>we muſt expect; but they having caught themſelves in this Net, the more they flutter, the more they'll fetter, inſnare, and entangle themſelves; for they cannot thus dance in a Net, but ſome Body will ſee them: For they are now as eaſily ſeen thorough (God be thanked) as they pretend to ſee through others; yea, this will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the Conſequence, till they uſe the only Chriſtian Means to get out of this Net, which is by Humbly Confeſſing and Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their Errors in their Books, as</hi> Geo. Keith <hi>has done,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To all which I cannot but joyn, and wiſh for their own ſakes it may be ſo; adding, that if ever it ſo come to paſs, then I ſhall ſee a great Truth in what <hi>Tho. Ellwood</hi> wrote in his Epiſtle to Friends, <hi>p.</hi> 72. <hi>viz. The
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65629:202"/> way to recover the Deceived, is to diſcover and lay open the Deceivers.</hi> In the mean time, taking it to be a ſound Truth, I have adventured to put his Doctrine in Practice, and ſo I conclude this Paſſage out of that Uſeful and Compendious Book from <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania;</hi> which had that People receiv'd my Advice in my Poſtſcript to my Book, intituled, <hi>De Chriſtianae Libertate, &amp;c.</hi> Printed 1682. <hi>p.</hi> 214. <hi>viz. To fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the Holy Scriptures, and read them diligently, &amp;c.</hi> this might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>And now, to conclude my Advice, leſt any ſhould prevent you taking the Advice I gave the <hi>Penſilvanians,</hi> 18 Years ago, as above I ſhall, according to my further Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in this Pilgrimage, tell you, that it was the Practice both of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Chriſtians, (which for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are one) to read and expound the Scriptures in their Aſſemblies, (which the <hi>Quakers</hi> call Conjuration) from Morning to Mid-day, and to give the Meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the People, out of the Law of God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth by <hi>Moſes,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.18,19,35. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.1,2. <hi>Ezra</hi> 1.10,11. and Chriſt himſelf went into their Synagogue, as his Cuſtom was, where he ſtood up for to read: And when the Book of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet was given to him, he found (which argues he ſought for) a proper place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and when he had read, he then, in a
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:65629:203"/> friendly manner, gave the Miniſter his Book again, and did not fall upon him, and call him Conjurer, Beaſt, Dog, Witch, Devil, Bloodhound, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">As the <hi>Quakers</hi> does our Miniſters.</note>, but preached out of what he read, and expounded it to the People; inſomuch, that the Eyes of all the Aſſembly were faſtned on him when they heard his Gracious Sayings, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.14,16,17,18,19,20,21. and at another time, ſuitable to his own Example, he bade the Jews <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, for they are them which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie of me, John</hi> 5.39. And after he was riſen from the Dead, how did he appear to his Diſciples, and reaſoned out of the Scriptures? Beginning at <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the Prophets, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf, ſaying unto them, <hi>Theſe are the Words which I ſpake unto you, whilſt I was with you; that all things muſt be fulfilled which are written in the Law, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, concerning me,</hi> John 24.27,44. Thus did he confirm the Scriptures by his Holy Example, both before and after his Crucifixion; he did not queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Hermes</hi> were the firſt Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thereof; or whether either or neither, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, in order to invalidate it, and to overthrow the Divine Authority of it; [<hi>The Quakers Refuge fixed,</hi> &amp;c. p. 17.] no, no, he confirm'd them, ſaying, <hi>The Scripture cannot be broken,</hi> John 10.35. <hi>Think not</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I am come to deſtroy
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65629:203"/> the Law, or the Prophets: No, no, it is</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs, than for one tittle of the Law to fail, till all be fulfilled,</hi> Matth. 5.17,18. Joh. 16.7. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Law is our Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.24. And it was his manner to go into the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogue, to Reaſon with them out of the Scriptures; opening and alledging, that Chriſt muſt needs have Suffer'd and Riſen from the Dead; proving out of the Scriptures, that the ſame Jeſus which he Preached (who was Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of, and in due time was Born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi>) was the Chriſt. Read <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>Micah</hi> 5.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2.22.18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1.9,7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.12.21.9. Read <hi>New Rome Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 55, to 58. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we may ſee, that neither the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles, call'd the Scriptures Death, Duſt, Beaſtly Wares, the Husk, Carnal, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Food, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Prophane <hi>Quakers</hi> Blaſphemouſly do; as appears from the Books of their Prophets, of greateſt Note, <hi>Fox, Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. See the <hi>Quakers</hi> Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> And if you will look into the Apology of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and the Writings of the Fathers; as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin, Origen, Chryſoſtom, Iſidorus, Tertullian,</hi> &amp;c. and into the Practice of our preſent Church of <hi>England,</hi> you will find the ſame: But for your further Inſtruction in theſe Matters,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:65629:204"/> I rather refer you to our Reverend Biſhops and Clergy, who can better inform you.</p>
               <p>Thus having kept nothing back from you, which I think may make a Diſcovery of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Faith, Doctrine, and Practice, to be contrary to the Faith, Doctrine and Practice of the Jewiſh, as well as the Chriſtian Church, to that of the Apoſtles, Primitive Chriſtians, Saints and Martyrs, in all Ages, I ſhall conclude this Chapter, begging of God to bleſs my Labours, to thoſe Ends by me deſigned, which are beſt known to him, and my own Conſcience; which, whether you believe it or not, is, That you may thereby be helped to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand your Errors; that thereby you may be prevailed upon to beg God's Aſſiſtance to help you out of them, and receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Thus then does it appear, not only by what is here quoted, but by what is taken from the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books, in this, and other of my Books; in <hi>D. Leed</hi>'s Books, in <hi>G. Keith</hi>'s Books, in <hi>Th. Criſp</hi>'s Books, and others; that <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is a Plot againſt <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and ſtrikes at its Root and Branch.</p>
            <p>I cannot but foreſee, that my old Friends will be half angry with me, for mentioning <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Plotting to Subvert the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But this I can tell them honeſtly, that ſince the Danger of that is over, and His Majeſty has, out of his Gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, pardon'd them, I ſhould not ſpeak a Word of it, did I not ſee, that he and his Brethren are in a moſt Damnable Plot againſt the Chriſtian Religion, of which I gave Notice in <hi>The Pict. of</hi> Quak. <hi>p.</hi> 72, to 102. But ſince that Alarm did not ſound loud enough, I have already, and ſhall yet ſound a little louder, ſo that all Ears may tingle, and Hearts may lament, when they ſee the Honour of our Chriſtian Religion defam'd, and the Holy Profeſſion thereof invaded by theſe Impoſtors. But why ſhould they be angry? <hi>W. Penn</hi> has given me a
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65629:209"/> Challenge to it, ſaying, <hi>This open Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge I make, That if amongſt the many Plots that have been ſpoken of, and ſeveral have been hang'd for, that there has been</hi> one known Quaker <hi>found amongſt them: I confeſs, that the Magiſtrate is excuſable in his Diſcreet Jealouſie over</hi> Us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then if one Inſtance of a <hi>Quaker</hi>-Traytor is ſufficient to juſtifie the Diſcreet Jealouſie of the Magiſtrates over the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Penn</hi> truly ſays; then to make up a Pair, I may give a ſecond Inſtance; namely, <hi>John Yates,</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who liv'd at <hi>Hull,</hi> a Maſter of a Ship, who for carrying Lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> in the time of the late War, had his Eſtate ſeiz'd; but himſelf fled from his Dwelling, and was forced to hide, as his Partner did, or elſe in all probability he might have been Hang'd; for tho' they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Fight, (as they ſay) yet they can carry Lead to make Bullets for the <hi>French</hi> to kill the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with. All which ſhews, that the Magiſtrates Diſcreet Jealouſie over the <hi>Quakers,</hi> is excuſable by <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and truly I am of that Opinion too; and not only in that Caſe, but in their moſt Horrible Plot againſt Chriſtianity, which tends directly to ſubvert the Faith in the Crucified Jeſus, and therewith the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity; and I pray God to give the Magiſtracy a due Sence hereof, and then to inſpire them with an Holy Zeal, to find out a Remedy.</p>
            <pb n="330" facs="tcp:65629:210"/>
            <p>For I do ſay, that to me it does plainly appear, (and to as many as of late have been converſant in their Writings, and who have obſerved the Tendency of them, together with the whole Frame and Model of their Church-Government) that <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> is a moſt Formidable Plot, and a United Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, both againſt the Chriſtian Religion, the Profeſſors thereof; together with the Holy Scriptures, and Ordinances of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and Supper, inſtituted by Chriſt Jeſus; alſo his Death and Sufferings; and that in order to exalt their own Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſet up amongſt them by their ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom they ſaid was raiſed up to be amongſt them in the ſame place that <hi>Moſes</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> tho' not in the <hi>very</hi> ſame Place, reſpecting Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Feet ſtood, as above obſerv'd.

            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> This is the fourth Warning we have had from the <hi>Quakers</hi> themſelves of this Plot, which they are laying, and which they are preparing for future Ages againſt the Chriſtian Name and Reputation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Magiſtrate. And that the <hi>Quakers</hi> Plot is againſt the value of the Death of Chriſt; the Exemplary Suffering of the Apoſtles, and Martyrs, read <hi>Burrough</hi>'s Works, <hi>p.</hi> 273. where they ſay, <hi>That the Sufferings of the People of God</hi> (call'd <hi>Quakers) in this Age, is a greater Suffering, and more Unjuſt, than in the Days of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or in any time ſince</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Here you ſee, that the Ten Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Bloody Maſſacres, and Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign, are all leſs than the Sufferings of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in ſeven Years time. Oh Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous! Oh Horrible!</note>. <hi>What was done to Chriſt and the Apoſtles, was chiefly done by a Law, and in great part by the</hi> due <hi>Execution of a Law: And hereby it appears, the Suffering to be more Unjuſt, becauſe what the Perſecutors of old time did to the People of God, they did by a Law, and by the</hi> due <hi>Execution of a Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, <hi>Reader,</hi> conſider what theſe new Prophets ſay; and if thou art a Chriſtian, I do ſolemnly appeal to thee, whether this Doctrine of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> hath not a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to cauſe the Names of the Martyrs to ſtink, in regard it implies they were Criminals, and ſuffer'd under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors by a Law, and the <hi>due</hi> Execution of their Law; for it could not be a <hi>juſt</hi> or <hi>due</hi> Execution, unleſs the Law were Juſt. Do they not hereby, what in them lies, acquit the hard-hearted <hi>Jews,</hi> the Barbarous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65629:211"/> and Bloody Papiſts, of their Bloody Cruelties, and Implicitly Charge both Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and Martyrs, with the Breach of ſome Juſt Laws; for which, their Penalties (ſay they) were <hi>duly</hi> Executed? And if ſo, is not this a Damnable Plot? Not to name other Blaſphemies, which lye Couched under this Doctrine; as alſo, the <hi>Quakers</hi> Pride and Arrogance, thus to exalt their Sufferings, from 1650, to 1657. to be greater than the Sufferings of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and Martyrs: And this Plot is ſtill carrying on with Vigour, not only againſt the <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> to make their Names and Natures ſtink in the Noſtrils of future Generations, when the ſurviving <hi>Quakers</hi> bring out their Books of Sufferings, <hi>alias</hi> Martyrdom. But behold this Book of theirs, with the ſaid great Sufferings, greater than that of Chriſt, and all his Martyrs, ſince was reprinted <hi>Anno</hi> 1672. and Witneſſed to by the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of <hi>Geo. Fox, Geo. Whitehead, Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah Coale, Francis Howgill,</hi> and their Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">For what one writ, the other avouch; they ſpeak all one Thing, are of one Mind.</note>; ſo that when they have gathered up all their Sufferings in the Reign of K. <hi>Ch.</hi> II. K. <hi>J.</hi> II. and K. <hi>William</hi> III. (for they are ſtill collecting all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings compleat and full, as in <hi>Pag.</hi> 84. herein) no doubt but they will make them to exceed all the Sufferings of the Patriarchs, and Prophets, from the Blood of Righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> to the Days of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65629:211"/> Chriſt, and from thence to the end of the Chapter, <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> O rare! This will be according to their Ancient Teſtimony in <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s Sermon; inſomuch, that this Helliſh and Damnable Plot is againſt the Patriarchs, Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Saints, and Martyrs, in all Ages and Generations. And this is the main Buſineſs of their whole Body, in their Convocations, both in their Monthly, Quarterly, Six Week, Second Day, and Yearly Meetings; which ought to be taken Care of, at leaſt Inſpected, tho' they have their Liberty of Meeting in thoſe Houſes, Licenſed to Preach and Pray; for at thoſe Meetings there are ſo many Spectators, that they cannot do that Hurt and Damage to the Chriſtian Religion, they do in theſe Private, Lockt, and Barr'd-up Private Conventicles. Thus then it appears, that this Plot is carrying on againſt King, Lords, and Commons; againſt Judges, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, and Lawyers, againſt the Reverend Biſhops, Clergy, and all Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; againſt Sheriffs, Conſtables, and Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boroughs; and indeed againſt the whole Race of Mankind, that profeſs Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: And therefore how doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern all Chriſtians, that have any Love to, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that have any Reſpect to our Martyr'd Anceſtors, who ſuffer'd in the Flames for our Holy Religion, to take Care of the Growth of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as they will anſwer the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

               <label>Objection I.</label> 
               <hi>By this time ſome may be ready to object, ſaying,</hi> Francis, <hi>Does not thy Zeal exceed thy Judgment?

            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſwer.</label> No, by no means I would not be underſtood ſo; for this I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, in the Fear of God, as I hope for Mercy at the Great Day of Account, when both they and I ſhall appear before his Great Tribunal, I do deſire neither; I would not have a Hair of their Head hurt: Beſides, if I did deſire the Growth of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> that is the ready way to increaſe them; for they glory in nothing more, than to be thought great Sufferers: No; let them have Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in their Licenſed Meeting-Houſes, to Preach, Pray, and Exerciſe their Talent, equal with others, if the Government think fit: And as this is all that other Diſſenters deſire or expect, ſo if they had not a further Deſign, this would content them, being that which anſwers the Subſtance of all their Petitions and Addreſſes to the Parliament, from one Reign to another, together with not being compell'd to go to any other Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And they having both granted, I think 'tis all that is neceſſary to anſwer the Ends of all their frequent and endleſs Solicitations:
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65629:212"/> And nothing of this do I deſire them to be debarr'd of.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Object. II.</label> 
               <hi>But then ſome may ſay, What other Way is there to put a Stop to the Growth of</hi> Quakeriſm, <hi>if they have this Liberty? Such an Expedient would be requiſite, if ſuch an one were to be found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſw.</label> I have once offer'd my Thoughts in this Caſe, and ſhall now enlarge thereon: For as I then ſaid, ſo I ſtill believe, that the main Requiſite to work a Cure, is to know the Diſeaſe, which, when found out, an ordinary Practitioner may preſcribe a Remedy, ſooner than an able Phyſician, who knows not the Diſeaſe. Beſides this, I have heard, that when a Bill for the well-Tanning of Leather was brought into the <hi>Houſe of Parliament,</hi> one of the Honourable Houſe of Lords being willing to inform himſelf into the Nature of that Affair, he apply'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a <hi>Cobler,</hi> diſcourſes with him about this, that, and the other Default in Leather, and what VVays might be found to remedy the Abuſes thereof, for the Publick Good. The <hi>Cobler</hi> tells his Honour what he knew, by many Years Experience, and told his Lordſhip how it might with Eaſe be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; inſomuch, that when the ſaid Bill came under Debate in the Houſe, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was ſo well skill'd, not only in the Means to be uſed, but in the Terms of Art, that his Lordſhip ſpake like ſome experienced <hi>Tanner,</hi> who by his Diſcourſe gave Light to
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65629:213"/> the whole Houſe. Now whether this was ſo or no, I will not determine, but 'tis not improbable, ſince the wiſeſt of Men may ſometimes improve by ſuch weak Helps, as in other Caſes 'tis frequent; ſuch a Virtue is Humility: And thereupon, in anſwer to the <hi>Objection,</hi> I ſhall ſay thus much.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Let <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and ſome others of the <hi>Quakers</hi> chief Leaders, and <hi>Fr. Bugg,</hi> &amp;c. be ſummoned by Authority to appear: And whereas <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. has given in a Sheet to the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1693. ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting, that <hi>Fran. Bugg,</hi> &amp;c. has wronged the <hi>Quakers</hi> in Charge, Citation, and Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and if <hi>G. W.</hi> can make it appear ſo, (for our Law judges no Man before it hears him) let <hi>Fran. Bugg, &amp;c.</hi> be made an Example. Again, on the other Hand, if it appear that <hi>Fran. Bugg, &amp;c.</hi> has not wronged the <hi>Quakers,</hi> nor falſly charged them, either in Book or Page; and that thoſe Points of Doctrine objected againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> by <hi>F. B. &amp;c.</hi> be found to ſtrike at the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Religion, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Faith, then let the <hi>Quakers</hi> be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to renounce them, and condemn thoſe Books which ſo teach: <hi>This,</hi> yea this, would ſtrike <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> to the Heart<note n="*" place="margin">This is the thing feared by <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> when they cry out, <hi>Fran. Bugg</hi> would ſtir up Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</note>, and give it a Mortal VVound, and preſerve the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> too; and the Books being condemn'd to be burnt, as it would remove the Scandal brought upon the Chriſtian Religion, ſo would it be a Means to reſcue their VVives
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65629:213"/> and Children from the Jaws of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> that Fatal Miſchief to Mankind, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve others from falling into it. For now many of them think their Teachers write and ſpeak from the Eternal Spirit; whoſe ſo ſpeaking is of greater Authority than the Bible: <hi>Truth defending the</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 7. And that 'tis as lawful to burn the Bible, as their Books, Papers, and Queries: <hi>Truth's Defence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 2.104. Then would thoſe, who are now Tinctured with the Leaven of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> vomit it up, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their Errors. This I take to be one proper Remedy, and poſſibly might effect the Cure: If not,</p>
            <p n="2">II. If the <hi>Quakers</hi> would Apologize, That now they Believe otherwiſe than they did formerly; then, as a Proof of their Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Converſion, let them (having firſt condemn'd their Books as aforeſaid) ſet out certain Articles of their Faith, in Plain, Clear, and Poſitive Words, agreeable to Scripture, (ſince of late they have ſo much pretended to be Orthodox therein) and at the Cloſe of them condemn all their other Books, which teach the contrary, particularly by Name.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The next thing requiſite, (to make a firm and laſting Cure to them, their Heirs, and Succeſſors) is, to admit each Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of <hi>Quakers</hi> to have their Teacher, (or two, if one will not do:) And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that thſe Teachers may attend only
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65629:214"/> their own Flock, and not to range all the World over; at moſt, not above Five or Ten Miles, to Hold-forth; leſt this Putrified Sore break out again, and the laſt end be worſe than their beginning: And as this, thus granted, is, what other Profeſſors, Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are content with, ſo will it anſwer all the juſt Ends of that Liberty of Conſcience, ſo much by them ſollicited for, and ſo graciouſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted by the Government.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Let them not be permitted to hold Yearly <hi>Convocations</hi> with Doors Lockt, Barr'd, or Guarded by Men, on Purpoſe to prevent Inſpection, in order to make Laws againſt the Laws of the Land; and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their Subjects, to repeal ſuch Laws as ſuite not their Deſign; which ſhews, that they are a Government within the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <note place="margin">Whoſe Laws thus made, they keep pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, even from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> For as this Practice no Diſſenters (<hi>Quakers</hi> only excepted) do deſire, (and indeed without His Majeſty's Licence, more than the Biſhops of the Eſtabliſhed Church can Legally do) ſo would it be a Means to work a perfect Cure of this (ſo much to be lamented) Gangrene of <hi>Quakeriſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Laſtly, That they may not be permitted to Teach School Publickly; for thereby they corrupt the Youth, and lay a Foundation for the next Age, for the Seeds of <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm</hi> to ſpring, and put forth again; for they teach <hi>G.

They ſee this, that, and the other Book come out againſt them, which they cannot anſwer, nor are they able to defend themſelves; and now they call out for a Ceſſation of Arms, and are for an Amicable Converſation; yea, for Peace and Quietneſs; and 'tis Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious to challenge them, and remind them of their Errors; this is againſt <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſay they. <hi>Geo.

Whitehead</hi> to appear on his own Propoſition to the Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> For each of us to chuſe four or ſix moderate Men of common Senſe and Reaſon, out of the Profeſſors <note n="†" place="margin">I call it his, becauſe he did vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offer to meet me before <hi>any</hi> Six, Ten, or Twelve moderate Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> of the Chriſtian Faith, and let us diſpute it out fairly, and above-board: And thereupon I ſhall renew my Challenge, and let it ſtand here as a Monument of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Cowardice, and Self-Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they'd rather lye under this heavy Charge following, than to come out and make their Defence, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they deny Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> who was Born of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſuffer'd without the Gates of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to be Chriſt, the Son of the Living God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they deny the Scriptures, by their ſpeaking contemptuouſly of them; calling them Carnal, Death, Duſt, Beaſtly Ware, Serpent's Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Preaching out of them, is Conjuration.</p>
            <pb n="346" facs="tcp:65629:220"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That they exalt their own Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Writings above the Scriptures, as being of greater Authority, and more Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; not only in Words, but in Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That they undervalued the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt Jeſus, by granting, they were inflicted by, or for the Tranſgreſſion of a Law, and executed in a great Meaſure (at leaſt) by the due Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That they exalt their own Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, as greater, and more unjuſt, than the Sufferings of Chriſt, his Apoſtles, and Martyrs; yea, even than all the Perſecutions, from the Days of Chriſt, to the Year of their Riſe, namely, 1650.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And that (for theſe and the like Reaſons) the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books (which thus teach) are Blaſphemous; and their Practices (in their Adorations) are Idolatrous.</p>
            <p>This is my Charge, which I have often laid down, and which I now renew, and offer to make good upon them, if he will chuſe his Men, and meet me according to his own voluntary Offer, and my Accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; or otherwiſe, becauſe I will give him his Choice of two Methods, <hi>viz.</hi> or on <hi>Condition</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">At <hi>Oxford</hi> I offer'd <hi>Sylas Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to prove the ſame Charge againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and their Doctrine.</note> that he, <hi>George White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> will engage under his Hand to Retract their Errors, if proved upon them, out of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books, wrote by their approved Authors, and condemn the Books which teach this Horrible Doctrine, promiſing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65629:220"/> my ſelf alſo to Engage under my Hand, to Retract what he ſhall prove Erroneous in my Books, or Falſe in Fact, relating to my Charging the <hi>Quakers,</hi> thereby making them publick Satisfaction; and to Burn my Books, if found Guilty, as a Teſtimony of my Injuſtice<note n="*" place="margin">A Sign of my not being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of Guilt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</note>: And to this I ſubſcribe my my Name, <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. 1698. <hi>Francis Bugg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is my Flag of Defiance, which I hold out to <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> &amp;c. this is my Standard, which I have pitched ON Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of my Saviour <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have Contemned, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd, and Denied to be the <hi>SON</hi> of GOD; ON the Behalf of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay are Duſt, Death, Beaſtly Ware, Serpents Meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ON the Behalf of the Holy Ordinances of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Inſtituted; ON the Behalf of the <hi>Church of</hi> ENGLAND, both <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have moſt wickedly Traduced and Abuſed, as Intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to bear, and Seditious in its own Nature. Let them come forth out of their Dens and Holes, and acquit themſelves like Men, if they think I wrong them, or elſe be content to lye under my Charge, as ſelf-condemned Perſons; and let them alſo know, that my Book, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned,</hi> &amp;c. ſtands unſhaken, and that <hi>George Whitehead</hi> is not Triumphant, but forced by the Guilt of his Conſcience, to
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65629:221"/> ſubmit to the Charge above exhibited, which is Ignoble and Baſe, on his Part, and will lower his Topſail, to his great Abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Shame, and Confuſion of Face, in the Eyes of all ſorts of Intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſtated the Conteſt between <hi>G. W.</hi> and me, and adviſed my Friends and Fellow-Labourers, not ſo much to Anſwer the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books, as to Charge and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them again and again, till they at laſt, (being confounded with Shame, Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Confuſion,) be forced to come out: But I ſhall ſhew <hi>Whitehead</hi>'s Fallacy in his way of anſwering Books, only by one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for I having in my Book, <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraign'd,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 47. by way of Retaliation upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who call the Publick Miniſters, Antichriſts, and Deceivers, and the World's Teachers, given Fifteen Inſtances, why the <hi>Quakers</hi> are the World's Teachers and Deceivers; the ſecond of which was this: <hi>The</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, <hi>who teach, that the Name</hi> JESUS <hi>and</hi> CHRIST <hi>belongs to the whole Body, and every Member in the Body, as well, and as amply, as to Chriſt the Head; are of the World, and Deceivers:</hi> New <hi>Rome</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pag. 47. Now this was no Quotation, but a Charge, which reſts for me to prove. I grant the Word <hi>amply</hi> is by me added by way of Illuſtration; but the Words <hi>as well,</hi> that <hi>G. W.</hi> neither
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:65629:221"/> mentions, nor diſowns. <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi>'s Words are, <hi>Doth not the Name</hi> (Jeſus and Chriſt) <hi>belong to the whole Body, and every Member in the Body,</hi> as well <hi>as to the</hi> Head? — <hi>So that the</hi> Name <hi>is not given to the</hi> Veſſel, <hi>but to the Nature</hi> in the Veſſel. <hi>A Queſtion to Profeſſors, by</hi> Iſaac Pennington, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 27. P. 33. <hi>The Scripture does expreſly diſtinguiſh between</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the</hi> Garment <hi>which he wore; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Him <hi>that came, and the</hi> Body <hi>in which he came; between the</hi> Subſtance <hi>which was</hi> vailed, <hi>and the</hi> Vail <hi>which</hi> vailed <hi>it. Lo I come; a Body haſt thou prepared me; there is plainly</hi> He, <hi>and the</hi> Body <hi>in which</hi> He <hi>came; there was the</hi> Outward Veſſel, <hi>and the</hi> Inward Life; <hi>this we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know,</hi> (ſays <hi>Iſaac) and can never call the</hi> Bodily Garment, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And whoever read the Scriptures, may clearly ſee that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are Falſe Teachers, in that they firſt teach, that the Name <hi>JESUS</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> belongs to every Believer, <hi>as well</hi> as to <hi>CHRIST the Head;</hi> ſince they can firſt call him, as you have heard, <hi>A Garment, a Veſſel, a Vail, a Body;</hi> but in expreſs Words they ſay, they cannot call <hi>Him</hi> Chriſt; but whoever read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by me quoted, in the Sixteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I hope they will be convinced. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>Then</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore took Jeſus, and ſcourged him. Then came Jeſus forth, wearing a Crown of Thorns: Then
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65629:222"/> the Soldiers, when they had crucified Jeſus, they took his Garments; but one of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with a Spear pierced his Side: She turned her ſelf back, and ſaw Jeſus; Jeſus ſaith unto her, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended:</hi> Thomas <hi>ſaid, except I ſhall ſee in his Hands the Print of the Nails, and put my Finger into the Print of the Nails, and thruſt my Hand into his Side, I will not believe. Then ſaith he</hi> (Jeſus) <hi>to</hi> Thomas, <hi>reach hither thy Finger, and behold my Hands; and reach hither thy Hand, and thruſt it into my Side, and be not faithleſs, but believing. And</hi> Thomas <hi>anſwered unto him, my Lord, and my God. And many other Signs truly did Jeſus in the preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book; but theſe are written, that ye might believe that</hi> Jeſus <hi>is the</hi> Chriſt, <hi>the</hi> Son of God; <hi>and that believing, you might have Life through</hi> His Name, <hi>John.</hi> 1.5,23,34. 20.14,17,25,27,28,30,31.</p>
            <p>Thus then it is evident, That the <hi>ſame Jeſus</hi> that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>ſame Jeſus</hi> which Suffer'd at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is the Chriſt which the Apoſtles preached, and which all true Chriſtians believe in; yet as evident, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> do not own him, nor believe in him: For, as above noted, <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi> ſays, there was the Outward Body, which they can never call Chriſt; <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi>'s <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to Profeſſors, &amp;c.</hi> p. 27, 33. <hi>G. W.</hi>'s
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65629:222"/> 
               <hi>Judgment fixed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 336. <hi>W. Penn,</hi> he ſays, <hi>But that the Outward Perſon which ſuffer'd was properly the Son of God,</hi> We <hi>utterly deny;</hi> W. Penn<hi>'s Ser. Apol.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 146. Well, but let us hear this <hi>George Whitehead,</hi> who thus reply'd, ſaying, <hi>I deny that the</hi> Quakers <hi>teach, that the Name</hi> Jeſus <hi>and</hi> Chriſt <hi>belongs to every Member in the Body, as amply as to the Head: Where proves he</hi> (Fran. Bugg) <hi>as</hi> amply? Says <hi>Geo. Whitehead. W. Baily</hi>'s Works, <hi>p.</hi> 229, 230, 307. <hi>The Sword of the Lord drawn,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Mark, <hi>Reader,</hi> here is a Tacit Confeſſion of the Words <hi>as well,</hi> tho' he carps at my Word <hi>amply,</hi> which I put in for Illuſtration ſake; it not being a Quotation, but a <hi>Charge,</hi> which I ſtill offer to make good, if he will meet me on his own Propoſition; for I take the Word <hi>amply</hi> to mean no more, but as Plainly, as Evidently, as Apparently; and the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, that the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> belongs to every Believer, <hi>as well</hi> as to the <hi>Head.</hi> This <hi>Whitehead</hi> denies not, this he diſowns not, only carps at the Word <hi>amply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore my Advice to all my Fellow-Labourers is, to take this my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, give <hi>New</hi>-Rome <hi>Charge</hi> after <hi>Charge,</hi> as <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> has done; ſee his Three <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives;</hi> as <hi>Daniel Leeds</hi> is a doing<note n="*" place="margin">A Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounded out of the Wilderneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 141.</note>; who has been a <hi>Quaker</hi> about 20 Years; and let this be the Teſt between <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:65629:223"/> 
               <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> If the <hi>Quakers</hi> be Innocent and Sincere, (tho' miſtaken thro' Error) they'll come out; if Inſincere, and Self-conſcious of their Hypocriſie, they'll not appear, but Rave and Rail like <hi>Rabſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi> at a diſtance; by this Teſt ſhall the Plot be diſcovered, and the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> be made manifeſt: And I am not without Hopes, but that what I have ſaid, in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with my Fellow-Travailers, will be a Means to preſerve ſome from running Headlong (as the Swine did) into the deep Lake of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> and and to convert others that are miſled, as well as be uſeful to the <hi>Church</hi> of God in general. Which God of his Mercy grant, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <q>I Have long ſeen (ſaith <hi>R.

                  <q>I am conſtrained (contrary to my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to plead like a Man of Contention againſt this Proud, Phariſaical and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Generation; this <hi>Leviathan and Crooked Serpent,</hi> in whoſe Noſtrils (unleſs a Hook be put) would ſwallow not only the Rivers, but alſo the very Sea into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Receive all (tho' never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean in Heart and Spirit, if outwardly they will but own him, receive his Mark <note n="*" place="margin">Of <hi>Thee,</hi> and <hi>Thou,</hi> and the <hi>Hat.</hi>

                  <q>I have obſerved, that thoſe that forſake Father and Mother, (the Sect that nouriſh'd and brought them forth) to follow the Lord fully and Holy (as did <hi>Caleb, Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c.) not minding their own Reputations, or Fame, not loving their Lives to the Death; ſuch, I ſay, have been accounted, as in all Ages, ſo by this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, Proud, Self-righteous Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the worſt of Men; calling them <hi>Ranters, Atheiſts, Blaſphemers, Devils,</hi> any thing, even all manner of Evil, ſo they may wound the Truth, and ſlay the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Defenders thereof; whoſe harmleſs Souls I ſee lying under the Altar of Truth, ſorely oppreſſed for their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereunto; and crying out, How long, Lord God, Holy and True, (will it be) e're thou doſt Judge and Revenge our Blood? For whoſe Elect ſake, the God of my Salvation will ſuddenly ariſe, and behold Enmity, Lies, and Falſhood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (even all that Spirit of Wickedneſs) will ſurely fly, hide it ſelf, and ſink again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bottomleſs Pit from whence it came.</q>
                  <q>They care not whom they ſlander, or what Lies they tell, ſo they may Advance, Strengthen, and increaſe their Party and Sect. By all which it evidently appears,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65629:226"/> that the Spirit of Deceit and Falſhood is crept in, and doth inhabit amongſt this People.</q>
                  <q>You are now like that Evil Spirit caſt out, running to and fro, walking in the dry places of your Elders Traditions, thoſe you call good Old Friends; ſeeking reſt, but never ſhall find any, ſo long as <hi>Balack</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> that bitter Spirit, leads to Curſe whom God will ſurely Bleſs, and bring over you; for ye muſt fall, and (with <hi>Haman, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>) be inſnared and taken even in the ſame Pit of cruel Deceit, which you have digged for your Innocent Brethren; and herein (for ſome time) will the Faith and Patience of the Saints be exerciſed.</q>
                  <q>Thus am I clear from the Blood of all Men, in that I have not ceaſed, both by Words and Writing, to forewarn of the coming of this Antichriſt among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who for more than Ten Years laſt paſt, have been that poor Aſs, ſpeaking as with Man's Voice, reproving and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Madneſs of this Lying, Wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Bitter, Perſecuting Spirit, knowing right well when it entred, and You there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by came to reject the Lord, that he ſhould not Reign over You by his Spirit of Light and Love; but rather choſe to your ſelves a King for to Judge and Rule You, who was not the Unction nor the Anointed of the Lord; nor yet the Olive, Fig, nor
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65629:227"/> Vine, that could heal, rejoice, or bind you up; but the Bramble, and King of the bottomleſs Pit, that ſhall ſo Rend, Tear and Devour you, till not one Stone ſhall be left upon another, which thing tell <hi>G. F.</hi> that Fox, your King.</q>
                  <q>By what is written, you may ſee how this high and <hi>Luciferian</hi> People the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who for their Shew and Numbers have been as the Stars of Heaven, and who for their Pride and Enmity are to be caſt down, <hi>whoſe fall is the Riches of the World.</hi> So that the firſt in Profeſſion, are now become the laſt in Poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, which ſtandeth, not in Words, nor yet in Outward Appearances, but in Humility, and Love unfeigned, yea, in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
